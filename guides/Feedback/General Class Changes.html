<h3>Foreword</h3>
</div>

<p>Warlock is currently a diverse and powerful class, with 3 specs that fill unique roles while being enjoyable to play. The issues with the class can be mostly boiled down to 3 categories: Cooldown Balance, Bugs, and Talent Balance.
</p>

<p>A reccuring theme across every warlock spec is that our talent balance is extremely flawed in many places. This leads to holes in each spec’s capabilities that certain talents should fill; Burst Talents for Demonology, Single Target Talents for Destruction, and Add Management for Affliction.
</p>

<div class = "left">
<h3>Pet Imbalance and Bugs</h3>
</div>

<p>Warlocks currently have what we believe to be the largest dps impacting bug in the game. All warlock pets currently have their energy regen scale twice off haste. This causes a massive imbalance between the pets, and a quadratically scaling haste value for all three specs. In the case of Demo, it also results in felguard not being the optimal pet single target.

<p>Add to that the fact that we have another HUGE bug, Affliction’s spec aura doesn’t apply to pets, and you have a recipe for a tuning nightmare.
</p>

<div class="left">
<img class="heading" src="https://i.imgur.com/G7hltT8.png">
</div><br>

<p>As you can see, my imp deals 585-586 damage. I have 1464 spell power, which means my imp has 1464. The spell power coefficient of Firebolt is 40%. 1464 * 0.4 = 585.6. If the spec aura was properly applying to pets, you’d get a result of 585.6 * 1.25 = 732.
</p>

<p>This secondary bug results in large imbalances in the value of Grimoire of Sacrifice between Destruction and Affliction. Destruction’s aura applies to both, but Affliction’s only applies to Grimoire of Sacrifice.
</p>

<p>We don’t believe there’s an easy solution where you fix the energy bug and just buff each pet by an amount, inevitably you will need to nerf or buff at least one of the specs based on the changes in order to keep balance the same as live.
</p>

<div class = "left">
<h3>Proposed Pet Rebalancing</h3>
</div>

<p>We’ve worked out a set of changes meant to rebalance pets, after fixing the bug, to a point where they all deal comparable dps (aside from voidwalker being behind ST) to Destruction’s Imp before the bug fix/changes.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Imp’s Firebolt buffed by 42% (0.4->0.568)</li>
<li>Felhunter’s Shadow Bite buffed by 70% (0.3->0.51)</li>
<li>Succubus’ Lash of Pain buffed by 70% (0.3->0.51)</li>
<li>Voidwalker’s Consuming Shadows buffed by 33% (0.075->0.1)</li>
<li>Felguard’s Legion Strike buffed by 42% (0.68->0.966)</li>
<li>Make Affliction’s spec aura properly apply to pets</li>
<li>Nerf Sumon Darkglare’s Eye Beam by 25% (0.32->0.256) to keep it's value the same as live</li>
<li>Nerf Affliction’s spec aura to 20% (25->20)</li>
<li>Increase Felguard’s auto attack damage by 44%</li>
<li>Nerf Grimoire: Felguard’s damage increase to 15% (25->15)</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two changes are due to the fact that even with the bug rebalancing, <a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/demo_pets_pre_felguard.html" target="_blank">Felguard still isn’t the optimal pet for Demonology Single Target</a> (because it wasn’t on live to begin with); We know it’s possible for blizzard to buff just the auto attack damage of Felguard, as it already has a hardcoded 10% increased auto attack damage multiplier on live, making this an ideal solution to buff Felguard’s ST without buffing it’s AoE. <a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/demo_pets_post_felguard.html" target="_blank">This puts Felguard</a> as the top dog for Demonology in any practical situation, while keeping the other pets close enough that you don’t feel incredibly punished if you need an interrupt.</p>
