<h3>Foreword</h3>
</div>

<p>Destruction is a thoroughly enjoyable spec that rewards careful planning of your positioning and cooldown usage. For the first time in a long while, Destruction has patchwerk DPS reflective of its complete lack of mobility. The havoc changes really allowed space for the spec to be buffed to the point where you can deal good single target DPS, in addition to cleave.
</p>

<p>There are 3 primary issues with the spec: too much of our DPS is reliant on Infernal, our AoE mechanics in general, and a lack of numerical talent parity.
</p>

<p>We would like to mention that with the cumulative total of the changes we propose here, the spec might be too mechanically diverse for the current tuning it has. Given access to better add burst and different AoE options, the spec may require a nerf compared to live DPS.
</p>

<div class = "left">
<h3>On the power level of Infernal</h3>
</div>

<p>Issue: Right now, Destruction feels very similar to how it did for large parts of Legion, and not in a good way. Right now, you drop Infernal once every 3 minutes and feel like a god for 30 seconds of the fight, and then feel like you AFK for the next 2.5 minutes tickling things. It’s not just that it’s such a huge portion of your DPS, but that it feels like you literally cannot move for 30 seconds or you’re ruining your DPS for the whole fight.
</p>

<p>The blame isn’t entirely on Infernal. There’s a volatile cocktail of talents and traits that result in massive portions of your damage coming from that 30 seconds period every 3 minutes; Crashing Chaos and Grimoire of Supremacy. Still, we believe that Infernal is too good on its own; <a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/vY82BsH3PYBxohc7JsFAFg" target="_blank"><u>Infernal stands at a tall 10%</u></a> compared to mostly 6-7% from other 3 minute cooldowns.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/e2So5L1vhmqfzEyJW7C3pp" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a>
Nerf Infernal duration (and Crashing Chaos subsequently) to 25 seconds (30->25), the damage of its Immolation by 20% (0.5->0.4), and buff Chaos Bolt by 10% (1.2->1.32). This serves a dual purpose: it reduces the period of time players feel obligated to perform perfectly, and moves damage out of Infernal and back into Chaos Bolt’s raw damage.
</p>

<h3>AoE Mechanics</h3>
</div>

<p>Issue: Rain of Fire is mechanically awful compared to most other AoE spells in wow today. It costs 3/5ths of our total resource, has a radius of 8, takes 8 seconds to deal full damage baseline, and targets a static location. It just feels awful to use in so many situations in Mythic+ where you know a mob might just randomly jump to a player, or run away in fear, etc. It feels backwards to me that Affliction’s AoE spell (although being insanely weak) deals its damage nearly instantly, and Destruction’s takes 8 seconds to deal its damage.
</p>

<p>Solution: Rain of Fire can be improved through any number of Quality of Life changes: give it a bigger radius so things have to move further to be out of it, make its base duration lower so they have to be still for less time, or make it cost less and deal less damage so you feel less bad when things move out of it (costs 2 shards but deals 1/3rd less damage).
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/sYbsEi8q5ajtXqphGMi1Kx" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a> Cataclysm is the biggest issue with Destruction talents right now. Unlike the other options on the row, it increases your single target DPS. This makes it very hard to justify using the other talents in any situation, as you’re always giving up some ST DPS.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/b66ysWt5G6Nwy91p9UDNYt" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a> Reduce Cataclysm damage on only single target by giving it an effect similar to the Arcane Mage talent <a href = "https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205028/resonance" target="_blank">Resonance</a>, causing it to deal massively increased damage if it hits multiple enemies. The values we found worked best were cutting its base damage by 2/3rds (1.8->0.6) and increasing its damage by 200% if it hits 2 or more enemies. If this change isn’t possible, Destruction’s spec aura would need to be nerfed to -18% (-16->-18), we discuss why at the start of the post.</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/3bqjM4eim7ua6W4ttjXm6F" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a> Fire and Brimstone and Inferno are too weak to see significant play. Fire and Brimstone may be close to Cataclysm, but Cataclysm's damage is all frontloaded, making it massively less restrictive. It's also considerably better for content (like most raid encounters) where AoE targets live very short periods of time.
</p>

<p><a href = "" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a> Increase Fire and Brimstone damage percentage to 60% (40->60). Increase the proc rate of Inferno to 30% (20->30). Inferno is a difficult thing to balance. It has immense synergy with Soul Conduit and scales much better than other talents are higher mob counts. I think, at this value, it will see play in keys where there are tons of AoE packs (freehold as an example), but may require further buffs. Increasing the proc rate beyond 30% results in rapidly out-of-hand scaling. If it's still too weak, I think the best thing to do is just tack on 'RoF deals x% increased damage' to the talent.
</p>

<h3>Talent Balance</h3>
</div>

<p>Destruction has many talents that are considerably weaker than the average talent in wow. This often leads to players feeling like they have no options, or that their choices aren’t significant. Some of our proposed changes may seem drastic, and that’s because the issues presented require drastic changes to address. Most of said talents are ~3% DPS gains; a talent that starts at a 3% gain requires a 2/3rds buff to hit 5%, the point where most talents are tuned.
</p>

<p>None of the talent changes proposed here are dependent upon the Infernal changes above, with the exception of Grimoire of Supremacy.

<h4>Tier 15</h4>
</div>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/i2tbjmeSRVhhBnHaj4bc3L" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a>
Soul Fire is too numerically weak to see play. The other options are mechanically better in many situations, so Soul Fire needs to be ahead in raw DPS output to see use.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/orSTe7yf2Fa4xDBJuNZY8A" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a>
Buff Soul Fire by 60% (1.0->1.60). This keeps it close enough to the passive talents while giving players a meaningful reason to pick it.
</p>

<div class = "left">
<h4>Tier 30</h4>
</div>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/kQP81EGWtrGLQnKEUU4qxw" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a> Internal Combustion is just a bit numerically lacking compared to the passive option Reverse Entropy.
Shadowburn was already too far behind in raw DPS output, and then Incinerate was buffed by 10%, making it even worse. Without Shadowburn being a competitive option, Destruction suffers from a lack of things to do while moving. The issue isn't just that Destruction can't do good dps while moving, that aspect of the spec is fine and it should never do good dps while moving. The issue is that you have one spell on a 13 second recharge to use for movement, and that FEELS bad.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/dehUp91fDwui1AoX554w2u" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a>
Buff Shadowburn damage by 55% (0.6->0.93). At this value, the talent will see play in situations where you’re moving around constantly, or when there are many short living adds. Buff Internal Combustion to 6 seconds per execute, or add something like 'dealing 20% increased damage' to preserve the current gameplay. It's fine that it's only tied with Reverse Entropy, because it adds consistent burst that is useful in many situations and scales better on <a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/hLUVKP1PqAUoA5H2fh34Nu" target="_blank">2 targets.</a>
</p>

<div class = "left">
<h4>Tier 90</h4>
</div>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/69dYt1BBC4cJ1UD5Hxkpqy" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a>
Grimoire of Supremacy is optimal even outside of its niche. Burst talents should always be tuned slightly behind sustained talents because burst is inherently more powerful.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/3k3YKQUzrFPRfNMtrVSbSv" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a>
Buff Roaring Blaze damage by 25% (0.16->0.2), and Grimoire of Sacrifice by 60% (0.35->0.56). If the Infernal rebalancing isn't possible, Grimoire of Supremacy would require a nerf to 7% per stack (8->7) to stay <a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/qtse4XXRqMRX7GGof7qu3N" target="_blank">even with other talents</a>, as it has great synergy with other buffed talents, namely Soul Conduit.
</p>

<div class = "left">
<h4>Tier 100</h4>
</div>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/mvo2QX2RixR1hhDCQEWM6x" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a>
Dark Soul: Instability is almost always the correct choice in raids. It’s numerically comparable or better than the other talents and gives you stronger burst. Dark Soul isn’t too good, the other talents are just incredibly weak compared to what 100 talents should be.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/GmtVK9Zdk4Qz5mxqJ84v4" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a>
Buff Channel Demonfire’s damage to its primary target by 30% (0.16->0.208) and Soul Conduits proc rate to 20% (15->20).</a>
</p>
