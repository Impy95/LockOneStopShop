<h3>Foreword</h3>
</div>

<p>Destruction is a thoroughly enjoyable spec that rewards careful planning of your positioning and cooldown usage. For the first time in a long while, Destruction has patchwerk DPS reflective of its complete lack of mobility. The havoc changes really allowed space for the spec to be buffed to the point where you can deal good single target DPS, in addition to cleave.
</p>

<p>There are 2 primary issues with the spec: a lack of numerical talent parity, and the mechanics of Rain of Fire.
</p>

<p>We would like to mention that with the cumulative total of the changes we propose here, the spec might be too mechanically diverse for the current tuning it has. Given access to better add burst and different AoE options, the spec may require a nerf compared to live DPS.
</p>

<h3>Talent Balance</h3>
</div>

<p>Destruction has many talents that are considerably weaker than the average talent in wow. This often leads to players feeling like they have no options, or that their choices aren’t significant. Some of our proposed changes may seem drastic, and that’s because the issues presented require drastic changes to address. Most of said talents are ~3% DPS gains; a talent that starts at a 3% gain requires a 2/3rds buff to hit 5%, the point where most talents are tuned.

<h4>Tier 15</h4>
</div>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/5ZUWNtkA6nzPYwMKyy8jjQ" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a>
Soul Fire is too numerically weak to see play. The other options are mechanically better in many situations, so Soul Fire needs to be ahead in raw DPS output to see use.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/2YPEX8ZVdHtC9UgjvxfGGX" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a>
Buff Soul Fire by 60% (1.0->1.60). This keeps it close enough to the passive talents while giving players a meaningful reason to pick it.
</p>

<div class = "left">
<h4>Tier 30</h4>
</div>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/c7MUotDPidqbbBq42WfG5E" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a> Internal Combustion is just a bit numerically lacking compared to the passive option Reverse Entropy. Shadowburn was already too far behind in raw DPS output, and then Incinerate was buffed by 10%, making it even worse. Without Shadowburn being a competitive option, Destruction suffers from a lack of things to do while moving. The issue isn't just that Destruction can't do good dps while moving, that aspect of the spec is fine and it should never do good dps while moving. The issue is that you have one spell on a 13 second recharge to use for movement, and that FEELS bad.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/wyzKN2Que1VjZ69whHMG8n" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a>
Buff Shadowburn damage by 55% (0.6->0.93). At this value, the talent will see play in situations where you’re moving around constantly, or when there are many short living adds. Buff Internal Combustion to 6 seconds per execute, or add something like 'dealing 20% increased damage' to preserve the current gameplay.
</p>

<h4>Tier 60</h4>
</div>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/qyo5jawqQMd9VDLUxtKXsa" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a> Fire and Brimstone and Inferno are too weak to see significant play.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/egziJLMAwVUo7Pj3bbL2cF" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a> Increase Fire and Brimstone's damage percentage to 65% (40->65). Increase the proc rate of Inferno to 30% (20->30). Inferno is a difficult thing to balance. It has immense synergy with Soul Conduit and scales much better than other talents at higher mob counts. Perhaps the better method to buff it would be to just add a large (25% should do the trick) damage buff to Rain of Fire to the talent. It should be noted, if Soul Conduit doesn't get buffed, this talent will require substantially larger buffs.

<h4>Tier 90</h4>
</div>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/mu1kot8HHvPQCqsy3sYVw" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a>
Grimoire of Supremacy is optimal even outside of its niche. Burst talents should always be tuned slightly behind sustained talents because burst is inherently more powerful.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/hLvetctNjnJDVgEXsMHt3c" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a>
Buff Roaring Blaze damage by 25% (0.16->0.2) and Grimoire of Sacrifice by 307% (0.35->0.48).
</p>

<div class = "left">
<h4>Tier 100</h4>
</div>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/8svBK2aZyAqb81y3RqT5sa" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a>
Dark Soul: Instability is almost always the correct choice in raids. It’s numerically comparable or better than the other talents and gives you stronger burst. Dark Soul isn’t too good, the other talents are just incredibly weak compared to what 100 talents should be.
</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/cB5QS1qE8uhGUgu2J8rnmP" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a>
Nerf Dark Soul: Instability to 25% crit (30->25). Buff Channel Demonfire’s damage to its primary target by 25% (0.16->0.2) and Soul Conduits proc chance to 20% (15->20).</a>
</p>

<h3>Rain of Fire</h3>
</div>

<p>Issue: Rain of Fire is mechanically awful compared to most other AoE spells in wow today. It costs 3/5ths of our total resource, has a radius of 8, takes 8 seconds to deal full damage baseline, and targets a static location. It is mechanically worse than every other ground effect in the game. It just feels awful to use in so many situations in Mythic+ where you know a mob might just randomly jump to a player, or run away in fear, etc. It feels backwards to me that Affliction’s AoE spell (although being insanely weak) deals its damage nearly instantly, and Destruction’s takes 8 seconds to deal its damage. I personally feel like that should be the other way around, considering the design of the specs.
</p>

<p>Solution: Rain of Fire can be improved through any number of Quality of Life changes: give it a bigger radius so things have to move further to be out of it, make its base duration lower so they have to be still for less time, or make it cost less and deal less damage so you feel less bad when things move out of it (costs 2 shards but deals 1/3rd less damage as an example).
