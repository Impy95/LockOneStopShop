<h3>Foreword</h3>
</div>
<p>Demonology is a spec right on the borderline of being both extremely enjoyable to play, and have both a numerically good and mechanically diverse toolkit. Few specs in the game feel as enjoyable as Demonology from a visceral standpoint to me. This iteration of the spec really captures the feeling of summoning hordes of demons to murder things. The gameplay is fast and thought provoking, with many short cooldowns and a rapid resource generation/spending cycle. Unfortunately, the spec is brought down in power considerably by bugs and a general lack of numerical talent parity.</p>

<h3>Bugs</h3>
</div>

<p>Demonology is probably the spec that has dealt with the most bugs throughout the history of wow, that remains unchanged today. Countless bugs, far beyond the list we're compiling here, plague the spec and bring it's theoretical dps down.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pets regularly spawn under the platform and fall forever during the Taloc encounter</li>
<li>Dreadstalkers most often do not give Demonic Core procs on expiration during the Mother encounter</li>
<li>Pets stop attacking Soulbound Goliath in Waycrest Manor when he is disoriented</li>
<li>Pets won't cross into Taloc's room, you have to summon them inside.</li>
<li>Pets have pathing issues during the Viq'Goth encounter in Siege of Boralus, possibly related to the cannons, resulting in them being unable to damage enemies</li>
<li>Temporary pets stop dealing damage and will not resume after their owner is Entombed during the Mchimba the Embalmer encounter in King's Rest</li>
</ul>

<h3>Talent Balance</h3>
</div>

<div class = "left">
<h4>Tier 100</h4>
</div>

<a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/iUsCS3gNXTZJMSUmNWX8Ua" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a> The recent PTR changes improved balance on this row drastically, but it's still a bit off.</p>

<p><a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/demo_t100_after.html" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a> Increase the damage of randomly summoned demons by 20%. Reduce the energy consumed per 5% damage of Demonic Consumption to 8 (10->8).</p>

<div class = "left">
<h4>Tier 60</h4>
</div>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/gzERzYkkJKWyn1EdsNHj43" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a> With such a limited list of spells influenced by From the Shadows (only Hand of Gul’dan and Demonbolt currently), 20% is just too little to ever justify its use.</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/gg1UNUr9MXTSmscL4kq5e1" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a> Increase its effect to 50% (20->50).</p>

<p>As an aside, I and many others feel like Doom just doesn’t really fit thematically with the new design of Demonology. It feels less like something Demonology should have, and more like something it has because there was nothing else to put there and it already existed. Personally, I feel it should be changed mechanically in some large way to better fit into the theme of summoning demons to murder things (please give us back doomguard I miss my friend :( ).</p>
