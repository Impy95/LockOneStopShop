<h3>Foreword</h3>
</div>
<p>Demonology is a spec right on the borderline of being both extremely enjoyable to play, and have both a numerically good and mechanically diverse toolkit. Few specs in the game feel as enjoyable as Demonology from a visceral standpoint to me. This iteration of the spec really captures the feeling of summoning hordes of demons to murder things. The gameplay is fast and thought provoking, with many short cooldowns and a rapid resource generation/spending cycle. Unfortunately, the spec is brought down in power considerably by bugs and a general lack of numerical talent parity.</p>

<p>Because of the rebalancing of pets around the Energy Bug mentioned earlier and the buffs to Demonology pets and talents, Demonology's spec aura would need to be * reduced to 5% * Insert link to demo_st_fixed here (10->5) to get it to the * same DPS as live. * Insert link to demo_st_live here

<h3>Randomly summoned demons are horribly bugged</h3>
</div>
<p>Currently, any randomly summoned demons (through Nether Portal or Inner Demons) do not properly have their duration extended by Demonic Tyrant. This causes Nether Portal to be roughly <i>half</i> as good as it should be. This needs to be addressed to give Demonology any semblance of talent parity.</p>

<p>Tier 100<br>
<br>

<a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/demo_t100_before.html" target="_blank">Issue:</a> Nether Portal and Demonic Consumption are numerically bad, even after fixing the Random Demon extension bug. This is a particularly big issue for Demonology because it removes two options that could fill a void in its toolkit: ST Burst. Nether Portal also feels like it’s too long to properly utilize in many situations.</p>

<p><a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/demo_t100_after.html" target="_blank">Solution:</a> Buff Demonic Consumption to 3% damage per stack (1->3) and the damage of Demonic Tyrant by 10% (0.325->0.3575). This puts it behind the other talents slightly. Given its short CD and fire-and-forget playstyle, I feel like it shouldn’t be ahead of Sacrificed Souls, personally.</p>

<p>Nether Portal is a bit tricky.<br>

<ol>
<li>We’d start by nerfing its duration to 15 seconds so that you can more effectively use its DPS. The buff is 15 seconds long and the pets last 15 seconds (without counting tyrant), so it still takes about 30 seconds to deal its full damage.</li>

<li>Remove the Soul Shard cost. It feels bad starting out your Nether Portal with only 2 Shards, and gives the talent a decent numerical bump.</li>

<li>Increase the damage of all random demons by 50%. In addition to the previous changes, this puts the talent slightly ahead of Sacrificed Souls single target. We think that it should be ahead, unlike other burst cooldowns; it’s mechanically requiring, changes gameplay in an interesting way, and is mostly backloaded damage.</li>
</ol>

These changes are contingent on how the pet energy bug is addressed. Our proposed changes to fix the Pet Energy bug restore the pets to the same DPS, and then buff Felguard’s ST DPS beyond that point because it wasn’t the best pet to begin with. This also buffs Grimoire: Felguard’s DPS, allowing more room to buff random demons without making Inner Demons too powerful.</p>

<p>Tier 15<br>
<br>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/5wNPv8JGUWTWhsDUse14cC" target="_blank">Issue:</a> Bilescourge Bombers is numerically weaker than the other two options in every situation.</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/dzSc1VJgEaXBY9KLk2Dwvd" target="_blank">Solution:</a> Buff Bilescourge Bombers by 36% (0.14->0.19)</p>

<p>Tier 30<br>
<br>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/gzERzYkkJKWyn1EdsNHj43" target="_blank">Issue:</a> With such a limited list of spells influenced by From the Shadows (only Hand of Gul’dan and Demonbolt currently), 20% is just too little to ever justify its use.</p>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/gg1UNUr9MXTSmscL4kq5e1" target="_blank">Solution:</a> Increase the effect of From the Shadows to 50% (20->50).</p>

<p>As an aside, I and many others feel like Doom just doesn’t really fit thematically with the new design of Demonology. It feels less like something Demonology should have, and more like something it has because there was nothing else to put there and it already existed. Personally, I feel it should be changed mechanically in some large way to better fit into the theme of summoning demons to murder things (please give us back doomguard I miss my friend :( ).</p>
