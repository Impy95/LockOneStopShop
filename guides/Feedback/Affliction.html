<h3>Foreword</h3>
</div>

<p>Affliction is a pretty well designed spec that’s enjoyable to play. You have strong cooldowns, high mobility, and good spread cleave. We think most of its issues boil down to the fact that talents which should fill holes in the base kit are just too bad to see use, leaving the holes in their place.<br>

I would like to say that I feel Affliction is too powerful currently and deserving of a nerf compared to live DPS. I’m not certain of a value, but 3-4% would put its ST DPS much closer to other high mobility specs.

<h3>Talent Balance</h3>
</div>

<p>Tier 15<br>
<br>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/fMhCDivv4FPWZz5L4tdY3S" target="_blank">Issue:</a> Drain Soul and Nightfall are both numerically awful. Drain Soul is a DPS loss Single Target compared to not having a talent. Nightfall isn’t hasted RPPM, which means it doesn’t scale with haste at all unlike the other two talents (and actually has negative haste scaling, as Shadow Bolt’s cast time continues to decrease).</p>

<p><a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/!!!!!!!!.html" target="_blank">Solution</a>: Buff Drain Soul by 40% (0.15->0.21). Change Nightfall to hasted RPPM, it’s proc rate to 4 per minute (3->4), and it’s damage to 100% (25->100).</p>

<p>Tier 90<br>
<br>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/j7zTYoLCkdECqnsS2RXHKc target="_blank">Issue:</a> Shadow Embrace is too short to feel good to play with or have practical success, even if it seems decently. Grimoire of Sacrifice is numerically awful.</p>

<p><a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/!!!!!!!!.html" target="_blank">Solution:</a> Increase the duration of Shadow Embrace to 15 seconds. Buff Grimoire of Sacrifice by 55% (0.35->0.542).</p>

<p>Tier 100<br>
<br>

<a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/hDnkNgUyQrzRmKZPN4VeJt" target="_blank">Issue: Dark Soul: Misery is always the correct choice in every practical scenario.</a>

<p><a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/!!!!!!!!.html" target="_blank">Solution</a>: Buff Soul Conduit’s proc rate to 20% (15->20) and Creeping Death’s effect to 20% (15->20).</p>
