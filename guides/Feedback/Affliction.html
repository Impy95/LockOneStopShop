<h3>Foreword</h3>
</div>

<p>Affliction is a pretty well designed spec that’s enjoyable to play. You have strong cooldowns, high mobility, and good spread cleave. We think most of its issues boil down to the fact that talents which should fill holes in the base kit are just too bad to see use, leaving the holes in their place.
</p>

<p>I would like to say that I feel Affliction is too powerful currently and deserving of a nerf compared to live DPS. I’m not certain of a value, but 3-4% would put its ST DPS much closer to other high mobility specs.

<h3>Talent Balance</h3>
</div>

<div class = "left">
<h4>Tier 15</h4>
</div>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/fMhCDivv4FPWZz5L4tdY3S" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a> Drain Soul and Nightfall are both numerically awful. Drain Soul is a DPS loss single target compared to not having a talent. Nightfall isn’t hasted RPPM, which means it doesn’t scale with haste at all unlike the other two talents (and actually has negative haste scaling, as Shadow Bolt’s cast time continues to decrease).</p>

<p><a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/aff_t15_after.html" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a> Buff Drain Soul by 40% (0.15->0.21). It's entirely possible Drain Soul needs further buffs; however, I think we should err on the side of caution here and just get it to a point where it's not actively a trap, as the additional mechanics it brings are quite powerful. Change Nightfall to hasted RPPM, its proc rate to 4 per minute (3->4), and its damage to 100% (25->100).</p>

<div class = "left">
<h4>Tier 90</h4>
</div>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/j7zTYoLCkdECqnsS2RXHKc target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a> Shadow Embrace is too short to feel good to play with or have practical success, even if it seems decently. Grimoire of Sacrifice is numerically awful.</p>

<p><a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/aff_t90_after.html" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a> Increase the duration of Shadow Embrace to 15 seconds. Buff Grimoire of Sacrifice by 55% (0.35->0.5425). In the Destruction post, I mention buffing Grimoire of Sacrifice by 60%, a value different from the 55% listed here. GoSac has an issue, it is worth a different relative amount for Affliction and Destruction. If it's left at the same value for both specs, it will either be <a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/fpWNQPRxxPXmwjocuh8WmR" target="_blank"><u>too bad for Destruction</u></a> or <a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/aff_t90_after_60%.html" target="_blank"><u>too good for Affliction.</u></a></p>

<div class = "left">
<h4>Tier 100</h4>
</div>

<p><a href = "https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/report/hDnkNgUyQrzRmKZPN4VeJt" target="_blank"><u>Issue:</u></a> Dark Soul: Misery is always the correct choice in every practical scenario.
</p>

<p><a href="guides/Feedback/Sims/data/aff_t100_after.html" target="_blank"><u>Solution:</u></a> Buff Soul Conduit’s proc rate to 20% (15->20) and Creeping Death’s effect to 20% (15->20).

<h3>All Proposed Changes</h3>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Drain Soul damage increased by 40% (0.15->0.21)</li>
<li>Nightfall's proc chance now scales off of Haste</li>
<li>Nightfall's proc chance increased to 4 RPPM (3->4)</li>
<li>Nightfall's damage bonus increased to 100% (20->100)</li>
<li>Shadow Embrace's duration increased to 15 seconds (10->15)</li>
<li>Grimoire of Sacrifice damage increased by 55% (0.35->0.542) for Affliction Warlocks</li>
<li>Soul Conduit's proc rate increased to 20% (15->20)</li>
<li>Creeping Death's effect increased to 20% (15->20)</li>
<li>Affliction’s spec aura now properly apply to pets</li>
<li>Sumon Darkglare’s Eye Beam by 25% (0.32->0.256), to keep its value the same as live</li>
<li>Affliction’s spec aura reduced to 20% (25->20)</li>
<li>Consider a further nerf to Affliction's aura, as the spec is already justifying of a nerf on Live in our opinion, and these changes make it more mechanically diverse.</li>
</ul>
