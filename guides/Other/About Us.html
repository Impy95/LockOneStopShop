    <h2>About the authors</h2>

</div>

<div class="left">

        <p><strong>Not</strong> is a long time Warlock player and theorycrafter ranging all the way back to Wrath of the Lich King. He is the <del>mastermind</del> creator of LOSS and main contributor. He handles all the nitty gritty and boring stuff of website maintenance, etc.</p>

        <p><strong>Gahddo</strong> is the love child made from math and mangos. He's been around the Warlock community for what seems like forever being the main contributor to SimCraft and now guide writing for LOSS.</p>

        <p><strong>Loozy</strong> is our loveable EU Warlock maintaining/writing the Destruction guide. You can usually find him hanging around in Turkey (the country, not the animal) wishing he could browse Imgur and look at all the dank memes he is missing.</p>

        <p><strong>Saocow</strong> is our main backend guy, if something breaks on the site he is our go-to fixer upper! All the beautiful things you see on the site were made possible by him.</p>

        <p>There are many more of us but these are the main contributors to the site currently!</p>
