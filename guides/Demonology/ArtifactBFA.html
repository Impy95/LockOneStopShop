    <p><i>Before the eredar served the titan Sargeras, one of their greatest leaders, Thal'kiel, had unprecedented skill with summoning and binding magics. Driven by ambition, he reached into the Void and was answered with knowledge of dark creatures unlike any the eredar had seen before. His audacious power grab infuriated the demon lord Archimonde, who struck him down, then had his skull gilded and placed on display as a warning. Today the dreadlord Mephistroth uses it to enhance his ability to summon and command demon armies for the Legion.</i> </p>

<h2><u>Thal'kiel's Consumption</u></h2>
<p>The spell that we get from our Artifact is called <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211715-thalkiels-consumption" target="_blank">Thal'kiel's Consumption</a>, allowing us to drain 8% of our Demon's HP and deal that drained HP as damage to our target. It is a main part of how we deal damage and using this ability at optimal times will be crucial for our DPS. The main thing to learn with Thal'kiel's Consumption is that the health siphon does not occur until the <strong>end</strong> of the cast from all active demons. It will be important to keep in mind the duration of your pets so that you get maximum value from them. </p>
<h3><u>Breaking it down in simple terms:</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Overall if you're looking for a baseline target to aim for as to when you should use Thal'kiel's Consumption it should look like this:</li>
    <li>Buff your Demons before you use Thal'kiel's Consumption</li>
    <li>Ensure your Demons will be alive at the <strong>end</strong> of Thal'kiel's Consumption's cast time</li>
    <li>Generally speaking you will have these Demons out for Thal'kiel's Consumption: Primary Pet, 2 Dreadstalkers, 6-8 Wild Imps (varying because of CD's)</li>
    <li>If any of these Demons are available to be used you should use them before you cast Thal'kiel's Consumption: Darkglare, Grimoire: Service and Doomguard/Infernal</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>General notes for Thal'kiel's Consumption:</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>The more Demons you have out, the bigger your Thal'kiel's Consumption will be</li>
    <li>2 Dreadstalkers are <strong><u>ALWAYS</u></strong> better than 4 Wild Imps</li>
    <li>It is much better to delay Thal'kiel's Consumption (or your Cooldown related Demons) +/- 15s to line them all up together</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Breaking it down in heavier/theorycrafting terms:</u></h3>
<p> In terms of demons and what is the best bang for your buck I'll refer you to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/178UWsHiHCXKHs5kms0X4n-DffKbrAccFF0XFu4PAg0A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a> (in this spreadsheet is also a Thal'kiel's Consumption calculator of sorts, allowing you to find out exactly how much damage it will do based on what Demons you have out) but the main thing you want to keep in mind are these parts: </p>
<div class="center">
    <img class="heading" src="http://imgur.com/NkI9jNj.gif">
</div>
<p>What does all that mean, you ask!?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each Demon type is assigned a value in relation to the value of your unbuffed Primary Pet.</li>
    <li>Because of this, your unbuffed Primary Pet (Felguard or any other Demon that is your permanent pet) is shown as 100%.</li>
</ul>
<h2><u>Skull of the Man'ari Trait Tree</u></h2>
<p>Upon first getting your Artifact you will have a trait tree that looks like this, Thal'kiel's Consumption and Breath of Thal'kiel as the only spots taken. Going forward you have a choice to make by going either to the left or the right down the weapon to reach the coveted <strong><u>gold traits</u></strong>. If you take a look at the Trait Calculator you will see that the right side of the Artifact is mostly defensive traits while the left side of the Artifact is basically all DPS oriented traits. Speaking from a standpoint of PvE, your primary role as a Warlock is to deal the most damage possible, making the left path the best one for you.</p>

<p>From there you have to evaluate the value of each <strong><u>gold trait</u></strong>;
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211530-stolen-power" target="_blank">Stolen Power</a>
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211219-the-expendables" target="_blank">The Expendables</a>
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211720-thalkiels-discord" target="_blank">Thal'kiel's Discord</a> </p>
  <p>The Expendables is clearly the best <strong><u>gold trait</u></strong> with Stolen Power and Thal'kiel's Discord falling behind it in that order, at least for the direction of our Artifact tree that we'll be going for. </p>
  <p>The full ordering of the Demonology Tree up to 35 traits can be found here:</p>

<p>Past 35 traits the following order should be taken:</p>

    <img class="heading" src="http://i.imgur.com/gnkB8bZ.png">
</div>
<p>You must complete the trait tree as normal before you can unlock the new traits for 7.2 as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0px"><a href="http://wowdb.com/spells/241252-swarms-of-the-black-harvest" target="_blank">Swarms of the Black Harvest</a> Increases damage by 10% and Stamina by 10%.</p>
  <div style="margin-left:40px">
    The replacement for "losing" the Paragon trait from 7.1.5.
  </div>
<p style="margin-bottom:0px"><a href="http://wowdb.com/spells/238073-left-hand-of-darkness" target="_blank">Left Hand of Darkness</a> Increases the damage of your pet by 5% per trait (2.5% per trait with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152107-grimoire-of-supremacy" target="_blank">Grimoire of Supremacy</a>.</p>
  <div style="margin-left:40px">
    This trait only affects your Felguard (or main pet) but is strong nonetheless considering how much damage your Felguard does.
  </div>
<p style="margin-bottom:0px"><a href="http://wowdb.com/spells/238109-jaws-of-shadow" target="_blank">Jaws of Shadow</a> Dreadbite increases damage taken from your Wild Imps' Fel Firebolt by 10%.</p>
  <div style="margin-left:40px">
    A very strong trait with incredible synergy with your Wild Imps. Upon Dreadstalkers being cast the mob affected by Dreadbite leaves a debuff lasting the duration of your Dreadstalkers that increase it's taken taken from our Wild Imps.</p>
  </div>
<p style="margin-bottom:0px"><a href="http://wowdb.com/spells/238145-thalkiels-ascendance" target="_blank">Thal'kiel's Ascendance</a> Demonic Empowerment has a 50% chance to enrage Thal'kiel, causing each of your pets to deal (50% of Spell power).
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    This new golden trait is a single target ability that your pets cast when procced. It is currently still being investigated more as there hasn't been much conclusive testing done with this talent yet but it has been confirmed that this trait scales with abilities/buffs that affect your pets. For example; Soul Harvest buffs your pets damage, thus Thal'kiel's Ascendance will also be affected. Grimoire of Synergy does not affect your pets, thus would not affect the damage of Thal'kiel's Ascendance. In similar fashion is it currently believed that our Mastery buffs the damage of Thal’kiel’s Ascendance as well but it is unconfirmed.

<h2><u>Important traits for relics</u></h2>
<p><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211119-infernal-furnace" target="_blank">Infernal Furnace</a></u></p>
<p>Another one of the minor traits that is a very desirable trait to get a bonus with for your Artifact Relics. Increasing the damage of our Imps' Felfire Bolt and effectively increasing the DPET of our Imps exponentially. Your goal will to have either this or Summoner's Prowess as the bonus trait(s) from your Relics.</p>
<p><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211108-summoners-prowess" target="_blank">Summoner's Prowess</a></u></p>
<p>One of the best minor traits we have. It makes your Demonic Empowerment stronger baseline, thus increasing their damage through faster attack speeds but also increasing your damage through Thal'kiel's Consumption with increased health. Your goal will to have either this or Infernal Furnace as the bonus trait(s) from your Relics.</p>
<p><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211106-the-doom-of-azeroth" target="_blank">The Doom of Azeroth</a></u></p>
<p>One of our many traits that is very simple in design yet can pack a punch. Increases the damage of our Doom by 10/20/30%, considering that Doom has all of it's damage backloaded it makes a hard hitting DoT even harder hitting. A trait that you will be wanting to get sooner than some/most others.</p>
<p><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211123-sharpened-dreadfangs" target="_blank">Sharpened Dreadfangs</a> & <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211099-maw-of-shadows" target="_blank">Maw of Shadows</a></u></p>
<p>I've lumped these two traits together since they do the same thing for different abilities. They both improve the baseline Critical Strike chance for Dreadstalkers and Shadow Bolt/Demonbolt. These minor traits are strong options to take as they are just flat damage increases.</p>
<h3><u>Other Important traits</u></h3>
<p>These are the other important traits but don't have relics that can increase their effectiveness, listed in order of best to worst.</p>
<p><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211158-imp-erator" target="_blank">Imp-erator</a></u></p>
<p>This trait is one that you'll get before The Expendables which is the only reason it's ahead of it in this list, simply increases the Critical Strike chance for your Wild Imps Fel Firebolt, a very strong trait for overall DPS.</p>
<p><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211219-the-expendables" target="_blank">The Expendables</a></u></p>
<p>Our bread and butter major trait. It is currently the best overall major trait because you are summoning so many Wild Imps throughout the course of a fight you will have nearly 100% uptime on your Felguard and can have some decent uptime for your Doomguard/Grimoire of Service: Felguard/Darkglare (if you're using them). 10% damage boost for your Felguard for the whole fight is huge; you are rushing to get this trait as soon as possible. </p>
<p><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/218572-doom-doubled" target="_blank">Doom, Doubled</a></u></p>
<p>Another simple yet effective way to increase our DPS. Currently the trait has a 25% chance to proc for Doom to do double the damage. This talent will truly shine when you have multiple targets with Doom and they all live long enough to take damage from Doom. Even on Single Target this trait is highly effective since Doom has the potential for massive damage output because it only ticks once.</p>
<p><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211530-stolen-power" target="_blank">Stolen Power</a></u></p>
<p>This major trait is one that is in hot water quite often. People underestimate the trait with good reason, it seems like an absurd number of casts for your Wild Imps to cast to even gain the buff. 100 is a seemingly huge number of casts, but when you break it down a bit further it's not as horrible as it sounds. Just as an example if you have 35% Haste and 3/3 Summoner's Prowess with your Wild Imps affected by Demonic Empowerment they will cast 11.76 (so there is some RNG to it because it could be either 11 or 12) casts in their lifespan. Assuming worst case scenario that is 9-10 Wild Imps worth of casts and considering you try to get 4 Imps at a time, that's 3 Hand of Gul'dan casts per Stolen Power buff. It's not amazing, but it's also not horrible. It is our Single Target trait in contrast to Thal'kiel's Discord being the AoE major trait.</p>
<p><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/211720-thalkiels-discord" target="_blank">Thal'kiel's Discord</a></u></p>
<p>Thal'kiel's Discord is our AoE major trait, it has a 15% chance to proc off Shadow Bolt/Demonbolt/Demonwrath and does splash AoE damage from <i>near</i> the target you're attacking. It's not a major deal for the most part since the damage of it is quite unnoticeable on Single Target and is a trait that requires you to try and proc it on the add/boss that the AoE will happen on/around. Due to the nature of our best artifact path you won't get this trait for a while as it will be more beneficial for you to level up your other Artifacts before going that deep into the Artifact tree.</p>
