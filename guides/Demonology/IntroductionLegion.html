    <h2>About me</h2>
</div><br>
<p>I'm known around MMO-Champion as Woz (it's an old name that I thought was cool back when I started using forums) but otherwise I go by the name Not. I've been around the Warlock community for the past 4 expansions but only recently started contributing with the start of Mists of Pandaria. I've played WoW itself since AQ40 but didn't raid seriously until Burning Crusade. I've played many classes as a main; Warrior in BC+start of WotLK, Shaman and back to Warrior again in WotLK into Cata (I did play Warlock in WotLK as a main alt and cleared all the content on it as well), played Warrior in Cata until the Maloriak wall and swapped to Warlock for the remainder of the expansion and have stuck with it since though thick and thin I just really enjoy the class as a whole.</p><br>

<p>If you're looking to play a more distinct and varied spec to play in the new expansion than this is the spec for you! It not only offers a unique single target rotation but also a unique way of AoE. This guide will provide you with this basics of what you should be doing for Demonology in a PvE setting. Demonology has once again gone through very major changes for Legion in comparison to Warlords of Draenor. Gone is the old way of Demonology with Metamorphosis and Chaos Wave and big damaging abilities and here comes the legion of demons to do your bidding. The spec has transformed into a more pet centric class where you have the ability to buff your demons and also deal some damage yourself but heavily relying on your demons for the bulk of your damage.</p><br>

<strong>Q:</strong> What would you say is the <strong>lowest possible</strong> Haste % I can be at for a Single Target rotation to work?

<strong>Q:</strong> What is the best way to use Demonic Empowerment?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> The <strong>best</strong> way to use Demonic Empowerment is to try and combo your Demon summons then Empower both sets of Demons at the same time. A combo summon can be:
    <ul>
        <li>Wild Imps + Dreadstalkers</li>
        <li>Wild Imps + Doomguard</li>
        <li>Wild Imps + Grimoire: Felguard</li>
        <li>Wild Imps + Darkglare</li>
        <li>Dreadstalkers + Doomguard</li>
        <li>Dreadstalkers + Grimoire: Felguard</li>
        <li>Dreadstalkers + Darkglare</li>
        <li>Doomguard + Grimoire: Felguard</li>
        <li>Doomguard + Darkglare</li>
        <li>Grimoire: Felguard + Darkglare</li>
    </ul>If you can't do a combo summon then cast Demonic Empowerment after the single summon.
</div><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> I specced Hand of Doom, but it refreshes the DoT....does Doom still do damage?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> Yes, it still does damage. No matter when you refresh Doom it will deal it's damage after 20s. Regardless of Hand of Doom being talented or not.
