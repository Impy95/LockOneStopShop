  <h2><u>Demonic Consumption</u></h2>
<p>
  Optimal use of Demonic Consumption involves some forethought or the use of a WeakAura/Addon to track the power gain from summoning Demonic Tyrant based on how many Wild Imps are currently summoned.<br>
  The power gained from consuming your Wild Imps is based on how much remaining energy they have:<br>
  <div class="center">
  <table class="grid" width=250px>
<tr>
<td><b>Point of energy</b></td><td width=50%><b>% damage gain</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>0.25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>0.50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td><td>0.75</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td><td>1.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td><td>1.25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td><td>2.50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td><td>5.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40</td><td>10.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>60</td><td>15.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>80</td><td>20.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td><td>25.00</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
  With this in mind you should be looking to summon optimally Demonic Tyrant with two sets of Wild Imps out that are summoned back to back, one of which will be at full energy. The cast sequence would look something like this:<br>
    <ol>
    <li>Build to 5  Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Cast  Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Build to 3  Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Cast  Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Cast  Summon Demonic Tyrant</li>
    </ol>
</p>

  <h2><u>Implosion</u></h2>
<p>
 Implosion is, as always, a topic of debate on how to best use the ability. Contrary to Legion Implosion there is a bit more of rotation, if you will, depending on if you have a Demonic Core stack or not.<br>
 We can explore these situations a bit more in details here:<br>
 <br>
 If you have <b>2</b> or more stacks of Demonic Core you...
 <ul>
    <li>Build to 5 Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Cast Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Build 4 Soul Shards using Demonbolt</li>
    <li>Cast Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Build to 3 Soul Shards using Demonbolt</li>
    <li>Cast Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Cast Shadow Bolt</li>
    <li>Cast Shadow Bolt</li>
    <li>Cast Implosion</li>
  </ul>
  If you have <b>1 or 0</b> stacks of Demonic Core you...
  <ul>
    <li>Build to 5 Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Cast Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Build to 3 Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Cast Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Cast Shadow Bolt or Demonbolt if you have a stack of Demonic Core</li>
    <li>Cast Shadow Bolt</li>
    <li>Cast Implosion</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  By doing this it implodes your oldest set of imps while keeping your new set alive for your next round of implosion. If you are more visual you can see how to do it in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2EKP6NoIz4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2EKP6NoIz4</a>

<h2><u>Refreshing DoTs</u></h2>
<p>
  Just like in past expansions we have the 'Pandemic' effect as baseline for any DoT or buff effects you cast.
</p>
<p>
  You're able to refresh your DoT or buff at 30% duration remaining and not lose time on your DoT or buff. For example: Doom has a base duration of 30s, 30% of that duration is 9s. If you refresh Doom at or under 9s the remaining duration will carry over to the 'new' Doom. There are many addons that can display Pandemic range for your Doom, for BFA I will be using WeakAuras to display that information.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to all this because Doom only deals it's damage once over 30s you can still cast it during the Pandemic window and it will deal it's damage no matter when you refresh the DoT. It does damage once every 30s, period.
</p>

  <h2><u>Choosing the right pet</u></h2>
<p>
  There isn't much for choice anymore since they are pushing each spec towards a particular direction when it comes to using a certain pet. For Demonology you are pushed towards using Felguard as your all-purpose pet.
