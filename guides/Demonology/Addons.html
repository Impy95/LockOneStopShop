        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            The quintessential addon for tracking anything and everything there is in World of Warcraft. There are many places that you can find Weak Auras including:

        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            This version of Doomshards has been modified to work in tandem with the Soul Shard bit change that comes into effect in 7.2.5.
            Doom Shards is an addon that allows you to track your Soul Shards like normal but has the added functionality of being able to predict/tell you when you will gain your next Soul Shard to avoid over capping.</del>

        DoomShards unfortunately has not worked properly for some time however there is a new Weak Aura by an amazing coder named Ipse who is replicating the functionality of DoomShards into a Weak Aura aptly called Ipse Shards which can be found by clicking on the link above. He sometimes has testing builds available as well <a href="https://wago.io/BkmU1Vqmb" target="_blank">here</a>

        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            An addon developed by our lord and saviour Zinnin that is basically an all-in-one addon specifically for Demonology. It can relay all the important information you need to know in a compact area. Development of the addon is still in the works for more customization options but you can tie in aspects of zPets with Weak Auras making it an even greater tool to have.</del>
