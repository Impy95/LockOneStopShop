</div>While there are many addons out there, there are certainly a few that stick out as great ones, here are some that I highly recommend:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/weakauras-2" target="_blank">Weak Auras 2</a>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            The quintessential addon for tracking anything and everything there is in World of Warcraft. There are many places that you can find Weak Auras including:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://wago.io" target="_blank">wago.io</a> has a variety of options that you can explore.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://wago.io/Vyx12GkVZ" target="_blank">This is my aura suite</a>, it has all specs included in one aura group.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- <a href="https://wago.io/Nk-REqT7G" target="_blank">Kirin</a> has also made a set of his own.
                 <li> -->
                    <a href="https://wago.io/Nkgbld8YW" target="_blank">Ipse</a> has always made a great set of auras for Warlock.
                </li>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/azeroth-auto-pilot" target="_blank">Azeroth Auto Pilot</a>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            This leveling addon has been vetted by numerous "speed levelers" and even I have used it multiple times to assist in the leveling process. A great way to figure out where to go and when without thinking about it at all!
        </div>
    </li>
        <li>
        <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auto-loot-plus" target="_blank">Auto Loot Plus</a>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            Another leveling/general purpose addon that speeds up the looting process. How fast does it speed it up? It makes looting nearly instant, you'll basically never see the loot window.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://wago.io/IpseShards" target="_blank">Ipse Shards</a>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
        DoomShards unfortunately has not worked properly since sometime in Legion, however there is a new Weak Aura by an amazing coder named Ipse who is replicating the functionality of DoomShards into a Weak Aura aptly called Ipse Shards which can be found by clicking on the link above. He sometimes has testing builds available as well <a href="https://wago.io/BkmU1Vqmb" target="_blank">here</a>

    <!-- li>
        <del><a href="http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/zpets" target="_blank">zPets</a>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            An addon developed by our lord and saviour Zinnin that is basically an all-in-one addon specifically for Demonology. It can relay all the important information you need to know in a compact area. Development of the addon is still in the works for more customization options but you can tie in aspects of zPets with Weak Auras making it an even greater tool to have.</del>
