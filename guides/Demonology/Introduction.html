    <h2>About me</h2>
</div><br>
<p>Well hello there. I go by the name of Not and I am the person who had the smart idea of getting involved in theorycrafting and making this very site. I've been around the Warlock community for the past 4 expansions but only recently started contributing with the start of Mists of Pandaria. I've played WoW itself since AQ40 but didn't raid seriously until Burning Crusade. I've played many classes as a main; Warrior in BC+start of WotLK, Shaman and back to Warrior again in WotLK into Cata (I did play Warlock in WotLK as a main alt and cleared all the content on it as well), played Warrior in Cata until the Maloriak wall and swapped to Warlock for the remainder of the expansion and have stuck with it since though thick and thin I just really enjoy the class as a whole.</p><br>
<p>You can find me on various social medias and Twitch with the following links:<br>

    <h2>Welcome to the darker side of Warlock, enjoy your stay...</h2>

<p>If you're looking to play a more distinct and varied spec to play in the new expansion than this is the spec for you! It not only offers a unique single target rotation but also a unique way of AoE. This guide will provide you with this basics of what you should be doing for Demonology in a PvE setting. Demonology has once again gone through an extreme makeover for BFA in comparison to any other expansion. Say goodbye to spamming two abilities back and forth to generate shards only to summon a few demons and say hello a more classic summoner archetype that fits the class very well.</p><br>

<strong>Q:</strong> What is the Warlock Discord?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> You can <a href="https://discord.gg/blackharvest" target="_blank">join us on Discord here</a>, it's a direct link to the Demonology channel. Feel free to ask all the questions you want!
</div><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> What traits should I be using in M+?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> Demonic Meteor, Baleful Invocation and Supreme Commander are all desiderable traits. Blightborne Infusion and Archive of the Titan are both viable options.
</div><br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> How do I deal with explosive orbs in M+?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> Warlocks in general aren't good at dealing with orbs, so they are usually your team's job to deal with. However, if help is needed you shouldn't ignore them. You can use Demonic Core procs on them as well as SoulStrike (or pet attack if not talented or on CD).
</div><br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> How does Implosion work?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> Damage to the <i>primary target</i> is based on the Imp's remaining energy. The less energy, the less damage. <i>Secondary targets</i> always take full damage.
</div><br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> How does the Tyrant extension and damage buff work?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> Demons that are alive when the Tyrant cast ends get extended. Wild Imps by default cast 5 bolts (or live for 15-20s, whichever comes first); however, during Tyrant their energy will fizzle allowing them to put out more casts. All demons get the 15% damage boost. Implosion does not get buffed by the 15% boost but it does gain value since energy is frozen. Bilescourge Bombers does not benefit from Tyrant extension.
</div><br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Do I use Felstorm on ST?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> Yes, you want to use Felstorm on CD. You can also leave it on autocast on ST situations; however, it is recommended that you donâ€™t so that you can have more control in non pure ST situations.
</div><br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Why is it that DB sometimes generates 1 shard on pull instead of 2?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> Shards reset on pull which causes your pre-casted DB to only generate 1 shard, if you delay your cast a tad bit so that it lands once combat starts you will generate 2 shards.
</div><br><br>
<strong>Q:</strong> Is there a maximum number of imps you can have?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> No, there is only a soft cap on the amount of imps you can have due to gear.
