    <h2>About me</h2>
</div><br>
<p>Well hello there. I go by the name of Not and I am the person who had the smart idea of getting involved in theorycrafting and making this very site. I've been around the Warlock community for the past 4 expansions but only recently started contributing with the start of Mists of Pandaria. I've played WoW itself since AQ40 but didn't raid seriously until Burning Crusade. I've played many classes as a main; Warrior in BC+start of WotLK, Shaman and back to Warrior again in WotLK into Cata (I did play Warlock in WotLK as a main alt and cleared all the content on it as well), played Warrior in Cata until the Maloriak wall and swapped to Warlock for the remainder of the expansion and have stuck with it since though thick and thin I just really enjoy the class as a whole.</p><br>
<p>You can find me on various social medias and Twitch with the following links:<br>

<p>If you're looking to play a more distinct and varied spec to play in the new expansion than this is the spec for you! It not only offers a unique single target rotation but also a unique way of AoE. This guide will provide you with this basics of what you should be doing for Demonology in a PvE setting. Demonology has once again gone through an extreme makeover for BFA in comparison to any other expansion. Say goodbye to spamming two abilities back and forth to generate shards only to summon a few demons and say hello a more classic summoner archetype that fits the class very well.</p><br>

<strong>Q:</strong> How does Implosion work?
<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <strong>A:</strong> Damage to the <i>primary target</i> is based on the Imp's remaining energy. The less energy, the less damage. <i>Secondary targets</i> always take full damage.
