<p>Stat priorities are fairly straight forward and don't require much (or any) thought, the best way to look at getting stats is as follows: Any scenario:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Intellect</li>
    <li>Haste</li>
    <li>Critical Strike</li>
    <li>Mastery</li>
    <li>Versatility</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Generally speaking something with Haste and either Critical Strike or Mastery will be best.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Intellect</h3></u>
  This is our primary stat, everything we do scales with it.
</p>
<p>
   <u><h3>Haste</h3></u>
   Haste rating increases the speed we cast, the rate our DoT ticks, the cast rate and attack speed of all your Demons; including your primary pet (Felguard), Wild Imps (summoned through Hand of Gul'dan), Dreadstalkers and Doomguard/Infernal. You will need 68 rating for 1% haste.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Mastery</h3></u>
  Provides a damage % gain for our demons. In BFA each spec has a different modifier for the amount of rating needed per percent gain. For Demonology a 1% damage increase is 72 Mastery Rating. If you want to see the formula it's here:
  <br><strong>((SpecModifier*Rating)/72)/100</strong>
  <br>So to find 1% for Demonology:
  <br><strong>72/1.45=49.66</strong>
  <br>Which makes the calculation:
  <br><strong>((1.45*49.66)/72)/100 = 0.01 which in game translates to 1%</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Critical Strike</h3></u>
  Increases your critical strike chance by 1% every 72 rating.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Versatility</h3></u>
  Versatility is purposefully designed to be a flat DPS gain, it increases damage and healing and reduces damage taken by a flat %. To gain 1% versatility you need 85 rating.

Because there is not really a set "best in slot" list these days with the continuation of the Titanforging system your best bet would be to use our auto sorting gearlist.<br>
We are currently working to get the gearlist working the best it possibly can. This can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_kaPijsmYIwU_lrFdld6W-fkugReYyC-87J887EZJ6A/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here using this spreadsheet</a> which also includes a handy video presentation on how to use it to find out gearing options prior to Uldir.

<h2><u>Azerite Traits</u></h2>
<p>
    To view all information about relics please visit the <a href="#/Demonology/Sims/Azerite" target="_blank">Sims > Azerite page here.</a><br>
Blizzard is still constantly tuning Azerite Traits and will likely continue to into the first few weeks of BfA. Right now there is only one trait that stands out from our gambit of specialization specific traits: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279879/supreme-commander" target="_blank">Supreme Commander</a>. There are several generic traits that are good however for Demonology. Just to mention a couple....<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273834/filthy-transfusion" target="_blank">Filthy Transfusion</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=281515/unstable-catalyst" target="_blank">Unstable Catalyst</a>.<br>
<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280284/dagger-in-the-back" target="_blank">Dagger in the Back</a> sims <b>very</b> well but it is highly inflated due to the sim being behind the target 100% of the time and having an extremely high uptime because of this. In real gameplay it will not translate the same.
