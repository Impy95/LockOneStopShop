    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196269-shadowy-inspiration" target="_blank">Shadowy Inspiration</a>:</strong> The biggest strength of this talent is by far the on demand Soul Shard gain you get from an instant Shadow Bolt, not only in terms of cast time but also in terms of movement. With how often we'll be casting Demonic Empowerment there will be <i>plenty</i> of opportunity to use this talent to the highest potential.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205181-shadowflame" target="_blank">Shadowflame</a>:</strong> Shadowflame is just a remake of the old Hand of Gul’dan, has 2 charges and is best used in the same ‘stacking’ style as Hand of Gul’dan used to be. The exception being that you can make Shadowflame stack a 3rd time instead of being capped at 2, further increasing it’s damage. This talent also provides you with a ton of mobility options but since it is best used in the same way Hand of Gul’dan was in Warlords of Draenor if you use it and only get the damage roll of 1 stack it’s not really that great in terms of damage, however it gives you another option for tons of movement. There is more information about this talent in the <a href="#/Demonology/Spec Mechanics" target="_blank">Mechanics</a> section. </p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205145-demonic-calling" target="_blank">Demonic Calling</a>:</strong> There are also great strengths for this talent in the level 15 tier since it allows you a lot more freedom in terms of your Soul Shard usage, especially when paired with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132393-recurrent-ritual" target="_blank"><span style="color: =#ff8000">Recurrent Ritual</span></a>. In effect it will turn Call Dreadstalkers into a Soul Shard generator (as long as you have a proc) giving you more opportunities to cast Hand of Gul'dan to bolster your demon army. </p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> In terms of pure Single Target Shadowy Inspiration is extremely strong right now with Demonic Calling not terribly far behind, because the rate of play has increased Shadowflame has mostly fallen out of play but is still an okay option.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196270-impending-doom" target="_blank">Impending Doom</a>:</strong> This talent is the go-to talent for anything that is sustained 2+ targets, as long as your Doom is able to tick. That caveat is actually the worst part about this talent since it pigeonholes you into knowing if adds will live past the point of Doom expiring since it would lose all effectiveness if they died prior to that point.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196272-improved-dreadstalkers" target="_blank">Improved Dreadstalkers</a>:</strong> Our single target option in this talent tier is a great option in terms of general DPS since Thal’kiel’s Consumption increases in output per pet we have, and this just gives us 2 more pets. </p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196277-implosion" target="_blank">Implosion</a>:</strong> The primo talent for burst AoE; but it does require some finesse and luck with your latency, I'll go into that a little later. Making your Imps suicide into a mob is a great feeling and is funny to watch them rush over to the target just to explode. There is more information about this talent in the <a href="/#/Demonology/Spec Mechanics" target="_blank">Mechanics</a> section of this guide. </p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> Improved Dreadstalkers and Impending Doom will be the <strong>only</strong> talents used for raiding, predominantely Improved Dreadstalkers as Demonology's major focus is strong Single Target. Implosion is great for leveling, dungeons and just general open-world things since it provides AoE when needed and can quickly kill a large number of adds easily. It also has the advantage of being snap burst when needed for target swapping or for immediate damage to an add.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a>:</strong> Should be usable in raids as a movement option when you need to go from point A to point B and back and forth, just like it’s used now. The worst part about this talent is that it is very cumbersome to use as it’s a 1 button talent as opposed to a 2 button ability. You’re forced to use a macro that cancels the buff in order for you to place your Circle in another location, which I think defeats the whole purpose of the talent in the first place. </p>
      <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/6789-mortal-coil" target="_blank">Mortal Coil</a>:</strong> Mortal Coil has been a not so great option ever since they removed the ability for it to heal you when you use it on targets which are immune to the horrify effect (so any boss). </p>
      <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/30283-shadowfury" target="_blank">Shadowfury</a>:</strong> With the addition of a cast time to Shadowfury this talent also loses a ton of functionality that we otherwise have had for a long time. A 1.5s cast time for a 4s stun is lackluster and not a talent I forsee being taken for much of anything except maybe PvP. </p>
      <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This tier is a no brainer, Demonic Circle is hands down the best option and will always be the talent taken for basically anything aside from potentially PvP and M+.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196283-hand-of-doom" target="_blank">Hand of Doom</a>:</strong> The sustained AoE talent for this row is a talent that is best taken in conjunction with a couple other talents (Summon Darkglare most notably but pairs well with Impending Doom as well) since it applies Doom through the use of Hand of Gul’dan. It will have particularly great synergy with Darkglare since Darkglare does damage to every target with Doom on it, which this talent supplies quite handily. There is more information about this talent in the <a href="#/Demonology/Spec Mechanics" target="_blank">Mechanics</a> section of this guide. </p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196605-power-trip" target="_blank">Power Trip</a>:</strong> If you're not into tracking more cooldowns or worrying about Hand of Gul'dan splash this will be the option for you. It's a very solid option in the overall scheme of things and allows you to concentrate on other aspects of your play. </p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196098-soul-harvest" target="_blank">Soul Harvest</a>:</strong> We have been given back another cooldown that has been sorely missed, unfortunately it's still very lackluster and pales in comparison to either of the other two options.</p>
    <p> <strong>Final thoughts:</strong> Currently Power Trip has a place for pure Single Target when paired with Soul Conduit as long as you have Thal'kiel's Ascendance, while Hand of Doom is the <strong>best</strong> talent for all others situations.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/219272-demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a>:</strong> Having this talent move down to this row makes it a bit more interesting of a choice. It provies a solid passive option of additional Damage Reduction and give it a bit more competition across the row of talents.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/111400-burning-rush" target="_blank">Burning Rush</a>:</strong> Status quo with this talent, solid option for movement overall. It's worth noting that the damage you take from Burning Rush <strong>does not</strong> take away from the shield you generate from Soul Leech. </p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108416-dark-pact" target="_blank">Dark Pact</a>:</strong> At first glance this talent seems out of place, but in reality it is a really fabulous option for Demonology especially. The shield you gain from Dark Pact takes it's shields from the health of only your Felguard including when it is empowered through Demonic Empowerment. It took a slight hit in potency because of the change of Health through Demonic Empowerment (from 50% to 20% extra HP). </p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This tier will be absolutely interchangeable depending on the type of fight you’re encountering but in general I would say Demon Skin or Dark Pact will be the go-to for progress, with Burning Rush left with farm and likely leveling.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152107-grimoire-of-supremacy" target="_blank">Grimoire of Supremacy</a>:</strong> Grimoire of Supremacy is <i>technically</i> the best Single Target talent of this tier....<strong>HOWEVER</strong> this is contingent on the fact that there is absolutely <i>ZERO</i> possibility of cleave or your Doomguard moving. Take this talent at your own risk!</p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108501-grimoire-of-service" target="_blank">Grimoire of Service</a>:</strong> This grimoire however will be one of the go-to's for this tier as it not only provides you with second pet for Thal'kiel's Consumption but allows you to have really strong burst AoE with a second Felguard and is a short cooldown for a relatively long activity time (90s cooldown with 25s activity).</p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/171975-grimoire-of-synergy" target="_blank">Grimoire of Synergy</a>:</strong> Grimoire of Synergy is still very strong, especially when you're able to pair it with either Implosion or Thal'kiel's Consumption since it scales the damage of both spells. Not only that but there is a very high up-time on this buff (close to 50-55%) so it is up on a very consistent basis.</p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> As of right now the best overall talent is Service from 1-3 targets and Synergy overtaking it at 4+ targets, unless using Implosion for snappy burst damage as required.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205180-summon-darkglare" target="_blank">Summon Darkglare</a>:</strong> Our AoE talent of the tier summons a Darkglare to attack all enemies with Doom (this is where Hand of Doom will come in handy!). It’s a very sustainable source of AoE damage and that’s exactly where the niche of the talent wants to be. Anything that is sustainable AoE this will be the talent to take (….along with Hand of Doom). Best talent for 2+ targets.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/157695-demonbolt" target="_blank">Demonbolt</a>:</strong> Functions in a similar way that Thal’kiel’s Consumption does in that it’s buffed per pet we have out, it has great synergy with a number of talents but since the introduction of Thal'kiel's Ascendance it has fallen out of grace for Single Target as it has no synergy with the new (and best) golden trait.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/215941-soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a>:</strong> This talent is a shining example of Demonology's toolkit since it fits a few different niches in terms of Single Target and AoE and fits very well into a more mixed playstyle. It's especially prevalent in dungeons where you may not want to be fully Single Target or fully AoE.</p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> Overall I really like having the options available to me for this talent tier, it doesn’t have too much bloat or overflow while still providing you with some very solid options to choose from for a variety of scenarios. Single Target Soul Conduit is king supreme but anything 2+ targets Darkglare is very strong.</p>
