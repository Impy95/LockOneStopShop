    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264078/dreadlash" target="_blank">Dreadlash</a>:</strong> Enables your Call Dreadstalkers to have an AoE proponent to them. This talent has the most synergy with Demonic Calling making it a pseudo callback to Chaos Wave of old. This may not be the top talent of this tier but there should be some application where a bit more consistent AoE is required compared to the other talents in this tier.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267171/demonic-strength" target="_blank">Demonic Strength</a>:</strong> Currently the defacto talent for this tier as it enables your Summon Felguard to have even more movement and target swapping ability (as it forces your Summon Felguard to charge the target you cast it on without using Pursuit). The damage amplification for Felstorm is quite significant and is on a relatively short cooldown.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267211/bilescourge-bombers" target="_blank">Bilescourge Bombers</a>:</strong> An interesting choice of talent that will provide us with some additional movement spells while also providing us with the option to take a talent which can hit another target at max range (think killing adds off to the side type of fight). I'm sure there will be some interesting uses for this talent.</p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> Currently Bilescourge Bombers is the go-to for this tier after it was buffed by 50% in the latest patch for all situations. There may be some very fringe instances where Dreadlash and Demonic Strength are used.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205145/demonic-calling" target="_blank">Demonic Calling</a>:</strong> One of the few surviving talents from Legion has changed slightly but is still in a strong position overall. It synergizes well with some other talents (Dreadlash and Nether Portal) while still being able to support itself on its own. There isn't anything overly special about the talent, it's just a good baseline option.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264130/power-siphon" target="_blank">Power Siphon</a>:</strong> The main application for Power Siphon is it allows you more options for movement where you normally would not have anything to do during those periods. It has some other applications in the way of burst as it provides you with supplementary stacks of Demonic Core to fuel your instant Demonbolt.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265412/doom" target="_blank">Doom</a>:</strong> Doom will mainly have its uses during multi target spread cleave where it has the ability to put pressure on all the targets where neither of the other options for this tier are able to provide. The flavour of Doom summoning a Doomguard if it lands a killing blow will never come into effect during a raid but might come up while in open world content and possibly PvP but should never be counted on as it's a very low chance to summon.</p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> Demonic Calling and Power Siphon are essentially equal to each other so you can take whichever one you please. Doom is still able to be impactful and is techincally the best talent you can choose <u>unless</u> you have either/or Supreme Commander/Shadow's Bite for Azerite traits, then you should always take Demonic Calling with Power Siphon slightly behind.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=219272/demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a>:</strong> Having this talent move down to this row makes it a bit more interesting of a choice. It provides a solid passive option of additional Damage Reduction and give it a bit more competition across the row of talents.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=111400/burning-rush" target="_blank">Burning Rush</a>:</strong> Status quo with this talent, solid option for movement overall. It's worth noting that the damage you take from Burning Rush does not take away from the shield you generate from Soul Leech.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108416/dark-pact" target="_blank">Dark Pact</a>:</strong> At first glance this talent seems out of place, but in reality it is a really fabulous option for Demonology especially. The shield you gain from Dark Pact takes it's shields from the health of only your Summon Felguard. </p>
      <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> This tier will be absolutely interchangeable depending on the type of fight youâ€™re encountering but in general I would say Burning Rush or Dark Pact will be the go-to for progress, with Demon Skin left being the passive option.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267170/from-the-shadows" target="_blank">From the Shadows</a>:</strong> This talent is falling by the wayside a bit as the damage modifier only affects very few spells; Demonbolt and Hand of Gul'dan. It can provide some interesting burst windows with Demonic Core stacked to 5 with Power Siphon available where you are able to get 7 Demonbolt casts and 2 sets of Hand of Gul'dan but overall is a bit lackluster.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264057/soul-strike" target="_blank">Soul Strike</a>:</strong> An interesting talent to say the least as it provides your Summon Felguard with an insane amount of additional movement and target swapping ability. The best part of this talent is the instant cast and the Soul Shards generation, both of which are insanely important for a multitude of encounters.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264119/summon-vilefiend" target="_blank">Summon Vilefiend</a>:</strong> A talent that looks underwhelming at first glance and depending on your other talent selection can be. The best use for this talent is when you are pairing it with Nether Portal since you are looking to get as many 1 Soul Shards summons as possible and well....that's exactly what this provides!</p>
    <p> <strong>Final thoughts:</strong> The most practical talents of this tier are Soul Strike and Summon Vilefiend with Summon Vilefiend. When you compare all the talents of this tier together however they are all fairly similar in DPS output depending on what you are doing, with the exception of From the Shadows - never take that talent currently.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264874/darkfury" target="_blank">Darkfury/a>:</strong> The reduction in cooldown will be generally useful when doing open world content but is not very useful (generally) in raids. Will be mostly used in PvP or open world content.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6789/mortal-coil" target="_blank">Mortal Coil</a>:</strong> Mortal Coil has a bit more utility because it can now heal you even on targets that are immune to horrify effects but is still not that amazing of an option.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=268358/demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a>:</strong> Should be usable in raids as a movement option when you need to go from point A to point B and back and forth. They revamped the talent to provide you with the old school Warlords of Draenor two spell version, one to set your portal and one to activate the portal. A major quality of life improvement.</p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> Demonic Circle is the clear winner of this tier for most every PvE scenario with Darkfury coming into play in Mythic+ and there will be some very limited uses of Mortal Coil, mostly while leveling.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=215941/soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a>:</strong> This talent is a shining example of Demonology's toolkit since it fits a few different niches in terms of single target and AoE and fits very well into a more mixed playstyle. It's especially prevalent in dungeons where you may not want to be fully single target or fully AoE.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267216/inner-demons" target="_blank">Inner Demons</a>:</strong> Providing us an ample and consistent supply of Imps is a great way to provide an extra buffer for our Summon Demonic Tyrant whenever possible. We also get the added bonus of random demon spawns (the same that spawn from Nether Portal) for some bonus damage.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=111898/grimoire-felguard" target="_blank">Grimoire: Felguard</a>:</strong> This talent exemplifies that the Summon Felguard is the go-to demon for Demonology and that we should be using nothing but Summon Felguard. Currently it is finding its place in burst damage situations.</p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> If you need burst damage, go with Grimoire: Felgaurd. If you need consistent sinle target damage, use Inner Demons. Soul Conduit could see some use more in a full AoE scenario akin to M+ to (hopefully) generate additional shards to get your imps prepared for Implosion.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267214/sacrificed-souls" target="_blank">Sacrificed Souls</a>:</strong> This talent is most similar to some of the effect from Demonbolt where it increases the damage based on how many demons you have summoned. It is a very consistent talent that is mostly the jack of all trades option.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267215/demonic-consumption" target="_blank">Demonic Consumption</a>:</strong> This talent is currently not worth using as it is basically a neutral/negative DPS gain. Look at the other options before attempting to use this talent right now.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267217/nether-portal" target="_blank">Nether Portal</a>:</strong> This ability summons a variety of demons within a pool of options which all have their own uniqueness and history with Warlocks. The current playstyle with Nether Portal is that you want to have as many 1 Soul Shards casts as possible during the duration. The reason for this is because the summoned demons out of Nether Portal are not summoned based on how many Soul Shardss are used for a cast, so you want as many as possible.</p>
    <p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong> At the moment the best overall talent for all situations is Sacrificed Souls. Nether Portal offers some comparable numbers now with the recent changes but is still niche with Single Target. Demonic Consumption is essentially a negative DPS talent and should never be taken.</p>
