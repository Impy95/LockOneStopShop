    <p>The main focus of this fight will be to maintain <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/603-doom" target="_blank">Doom</a> on as many targets as possible. This includes both bosses and all adds that spawn throughout the encounter to try spawning as many Wild Imps as possible.<br>
    For the most bang for your buck it is recommended that you use <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132374-kazzaks-final-curse" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000">Kazzak's Final Curse</span></a> and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132369-wilfreds-sigil-of-superior-summoning" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000">Wilfred's Sigil of Superior Summoning</span></a> as your two legendaries as they synergize well with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196270-impending-doom" target="_blank">Impending Doom</a> and the pure amount of demons you'll have out on average throughout the encounter to contribute towards <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/603-doom" target="_blank">Doom</a> damage and additional summons of Doomguard.<br>
    Using your <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a> effectively will be one of your best friends. Try keeping it off to the side so you can either portal out when Atrigan casts <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/233431-calcified-quills" target="_blank"<span style="color: #66C4FF">Calcified Quills</a> on you or if you find yourself inside a <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/233431-calcified-quills" target="_blank"<span style="color: #66C4FF">Calcified Quills</a> circle. This will reduce the amount of torment you actually gain throughout the encounter.
