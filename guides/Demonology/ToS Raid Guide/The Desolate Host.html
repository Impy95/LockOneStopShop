    <p>For this fight in particular the real benefit of playing Demonology comes with a little finesse and playing around with putting <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/603-doom" target="_blank">Doom</a> on as many Templars as possible to spawn Wild Imps. When the Templars are tanked far enough away from you the Wild Imps will simply spawn on top of you and attack your primary target.<br>
    For maximum DPS it is recommended that you use <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132374-kazzaks-final-curse" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000">Kazzak's Final Curse</span></a> and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132369-wilfreds-sigil-of-superior-summoning" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000">Wilfred's Sigil of Superior Summoning</span></a> as your two legendaries as they synergize well with Impending Doom and the pure amount of demons you'll have out on average throughout the encounter to contribute towards Doom damage and additional summons of Doomguard.
