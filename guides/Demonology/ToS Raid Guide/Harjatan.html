    <p>For this fight you are looking to splash your Hand of Gul'dan onto as many targets as possible while maintaining Harjatan as your main target. Spawning as many Wild Imps as possible off the adds is where your DPS will be at.<br>
    In particular it is recommended to use <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132374-kazzaks-final-curse" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000">Kazzak's Final Curse</span></a> and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132369-wilfreds-sigil-of-superior-summoning" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000">Wilfred's Sigil of Superior Summoning</span></a> as your two legendaries as they synergize well with Impending Doom and the pure amount of demons you'll have out on average throughout the encounter to contribute towards Doom damage and additional summons of Doomguard.<br>
    Placing your <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a> off to the side so you can teleport out when the boss starts to draw in the pools is great for reducing movement required throughout the fight.
