    <p>This entire encounter is single target with some extra abilities within the fight that you will be playing around. In particular you will be playing around the Blowback ability, after this ability is cast she summons a number of fel and light orbs. Standing on or near these orbs (so long as they are the same colour as yours) will give you a stacking damage increase. It is recommended to align your second or third set of cooldowns with this debuff.<br>
    You'll see the best results using any combination of the more 'single target' oriented legendaries including; <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132393-recurrent-ritual" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000">Recurrent Ritual</span></a>, <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132369-wilfreds-sigil-of-superior-summoning" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000">Wilfred's Sigil of Superior Summoning</span></a> or <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/144385-wakeners-loyalty" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000">Wakener's Loyalty</span></a>.
