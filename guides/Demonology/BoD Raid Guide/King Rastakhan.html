    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
   This is a primarily single target multi-phase encounter that begins with 2 adds before the boss, King Rastakhan, becomes attackable.  When Rastakhan hits 60% Phase 3 begins and much of the raid will go into a death realm (aka "downstairs") to burst Bwonsamdi to 50% hp when Phase 4 begins.  A couple adds spawn in Phase 4 although they are often just CC'd while you burn the boss.  Phase 1 and 2 are fairly low movement and thus favor <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264119/summon-vilefiend" target="_blank">Vilefiend</a>, while Phase 3 and 4 are higher movement and thus favor <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264057/soul-strike" target="_blank">Soul Strike</a> especially if you are going into the death realm and need to dodge <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288048/death-rift" target="_blank">Death Rifts</a>.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>
   
    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li>You can stun mind controlled targets with Shadowfury and Axe Toss to prevent them from running around and casting. Fear also works to prevent them from casting though can cause them to run into the melee stack or the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285190/aura-of-death" target="blank">Aura of Death</a> so should generally be avoided.</li> 
    <li>Gateway and Circle can be used to maximize casting in Phase 4 during <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287333/inevitable-end" target="_blank">Inevitable End</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    The Mythic version of this encounter is basically a beefed up version of Heroic and very little changes for Demonology.
    <!--## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li>Bwonsamdi's <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285190/aura-of-death" target="blank">Aura of Death</a> is significantly larger (45 yards) in Mythic and positioning will be more cramped, make sure to maintain a decent range spread to minimize movement.</li>
    <li>Two people will get mind controlled on Mythic so the above comments about stuns and fear are more necessary.</li>
    <li>All range are typically assigned to death realm in Mythic so <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267215/demonic-consumption" target="_blank">Demonic Consumption</a> is generally preferred for the shorter burst due to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287333/inevitable-end" target="_blank">Inevitable End</a> occuring fairly soon in the burst phase.</li>
    </ul>
