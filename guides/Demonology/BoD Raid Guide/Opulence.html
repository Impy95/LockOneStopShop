    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
   This is a primarily single target encounter and single target traits and talents are preferred.  There is pretty high movement in the first phase, especially on the fire (right) side, so <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264057/soul-strike" target="_blank">Soul Strike</a> is recommended if you are struggling here, although <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264119/summon-vilefiend" target="_blank">Vilefiend</a> will provide more damage in the final burn.  In a similar vein, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267215/demonic-consumption" target="_blank">Demonic Consumption</a> is preferred for phase 1 as you are unlikely to able to suffuciently execute the full <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267217/nether-portal" target="_blank">Nether Portal</a> opener, while Nether Portal remains the strongest option for the low-movement final burn. The gem of choice for this boss is Opal (left side, blue) unless you are assigned to Topaz or Ruby, although shorter kills may favor Emerald. As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>
   
    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->

    <li>You should hold Nether Portal and Tyrant in phase 2 until the second add wave to maximize Opal benefit.</li>
    <li>Demo is capable of massive aoe burst onto the Spirits of Gold in phase 2. Save some imps for implosion, Felstorm, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267211/bilescourge-bombers" target="_blank">Bilescourge Bombers</a>
 or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267171/demonic-strength" target="_blank">Demonic Strength</a> to quickly kill them before the dot classes have a chance to pad!</li>
    <li>Shadowfury can stun the adds to keep them in melee range for as long as possible, coordinate with your group to determine an aoe stun rotation.</li>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    In mythic you will get randomly swapped between rooms during phase 1 via <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=289383/chaotic-displacement" target="_blank">Chaotic Displacement</a>, and after getting swapped you are immune to damage for 10 seconds so long as you don't move.  Be extremely careful to utilize this effect to avoid dying to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285479/flame-jet" target="_blank">Flame Jets</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=282939/flames-of-punishment" target="_blank">Flames of Punishment</a> immediately after a swap.  Phase 1 lasts significantly longer in mythic (5+ mins) and getting everyone through alive will be drastically more difficult.
    <!--## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    
    <li>The Spirits of Gold adds live a lot longer in mythic so you will swap to aoe rotation while they are active.  The second set will likely live long enough to get a juicy Tyrant implosion and Felguard off before they have died, so plan your cooldowns accordingly.</li>
    <li>There are a couple annoying effects with the phase 1 swap for demo; none of your guardians will follow you, so avoid summoning pets before the swap and implode any imps, and your Felguard often will go passive so be sure to watch him and have a /petattack macro bound for when he stops attacking.</li>
    <li>Place your Circle on the boss in phase 2 to quickly return to the group after dropping <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287072/liquid-gold" target="_blank">Liquid Gold</a>.</li>
