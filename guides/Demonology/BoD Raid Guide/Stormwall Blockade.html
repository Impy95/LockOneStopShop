    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
     This is a multi-phased encounter with a mix of single target and spread cleave.  Phase 1 is largely a single target burn of the two phase one bosses while ocasionally dealing with a Siren while Brother Joseph is on your boat.  Phase 2 is a spread cleave phase with adds spawning at range that must be slowed and bursted down. Any of your usual talent setups with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267215/demonic-consumption" target="_blank">Demonic Consumption</a> will work well here as you simply cannot make ample use of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267217/nether-portal" target="_blank">Nether Portal</a> due to phase timing and frequent movement, As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    The major difference in the mythic version of this encounter is that the phase 1 mechanics continue into phase 2, namely the siren spawns.  This turns a primarily single-target burn into a heavily multi-target phase.  Swap to adds as needed, but since demo has little multi-dot capability this should still be treated as a largely single target encounter with some add swaps as needed.
