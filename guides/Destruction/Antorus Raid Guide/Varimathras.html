    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <p>You can use your Demonic Circle to get back into the group after running out with Necrotic Embrace. This is mainly only doable on Heroic as your mythic tactic may not allow you to do this.</p>
    <p>During the Torment of Frost phase you can use Burning Rush to not drop below 100% movement speed. Make sure you dont run more than 8 yards away from people though as you dont want to trigger an Alone in the Darkness.</p>
    <p>On Mythic difficulty you want to swap to the Shadow of Varimathras as quickly as you can. I suggest using Conflagrate on these as your Chaos Bolt may not hit it before it's too late.</p>
