    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <p>Make sure you dont cast Havoc as your tanks are about to swap bosses. This makes the bosses take reduced damage so rather delay it a little bit.</p>
    <p>The bossses have to be 18 yards away from each other, this is still in range of Magistrike Restraints so you may want to use this.</p>
    <p>During the Torment of Norgannon intermission you can cast Banish to stop an add. Keep in mind this means you either have to kill the add after banish runs off or unbanish it before it runs out.</p>
