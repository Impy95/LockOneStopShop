    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <p>On Normal and Heroic make sure you have cooldowns ready 30 seconds after Argus reaches 40%. This means you'll have cooldowns for Constellar Designates.</p>
    <p>During this phase you should mainly target the add taking increased fire damage since your Incinerate, Conflagrate and Immolate are all fire damage. Then use Havoc onto any of the other adds and cast as many Chaos Bolt during that time as possible. This is Chaos damage and will deal increased damage to any of the adds.</p>
    <p>During the final phase you'll want to make sure to save Soul Shards to focus the Reorigination Module. These are going to be very high priority as they're casting Reorigination Pulse and if this finishes casting you will most likely wipe.</p>
