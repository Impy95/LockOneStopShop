<h2>Spec Mechanics</h2>

<p>Destruction Warlocks main ressource is Soul Shards but unlike Affliction and Demonology our soul shards are actually split up into 10 fragments. That means you need to generate 10 Soul Shard Fragments in order to have a full Soul Shard you then can spend on something.</p>

<h3>Generators</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/348-immolate">Immolate</a> - Applies a debuff to your target that deals damage over 18 second. Periodic damage generates 1 Soul Shard Fragment and has a 50% chance to generate an additional 1 on critical strikes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/17962-conflagrate">Conflagrate</a> - Instant cast that deals damage and generates 3 Soul Shard Fragments. This also grants you 1 stack of Backdraft (2 if specced Flashover).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/29722-incinerate">Incinerate</a> - Main generator and filler spell that generates 2 Soul Shard Fragments and an additional 1 on critical strikes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1122/summon-infernal">Summon Infernal</a> - Our main damage cooldown can now also be considered a generator. While your infernal is active you will generate 1 Soul Shard Fragment every 0.5 seconds.</p>

<h3>Spenders</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116858-chaos-bolt">Chaos Bolt</a> - Primary Soul Shard spender. Costs 2 Soul Shards, is a relatively long cast but also deals a large amount of damage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5740-rain-of-fire">Rain of Fire</a> - Our main AoE spell, costs 3 Soul Shards and deals damage over 8 seconds at a targeted location.</p>

<h3>Pandemic</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You'll see this term a lot when researching Warlock. The basic concept is that you want to refresh a DoT when it has 30% of it's base duration remaining or less: <=5.4 for Immolate.</li>
    <li>Refreshing before a DoT hits 30% isn't the end of the world: the dps loss is tiny, and can actually be a dps gain if you're moving.</li>
    <li>Complicated Explanation (skip this if you don't care about math): Every DoT and HoT in wow can have its duration extended to up to 30% over base duration (130% total). When you apply a DoT/HoT, you effectively add 100% of its duration to the debuff. If you refresh a DoT/HoT at <30% of its base duration, you end up at or below 130%. If you refresh before the DoT/HoT hits 30%, you end up with more than 130%. Anything over 130% gets wasted.</li>
    <li>Example: Immolate has a base duration of 18 seconds. The max duration it can have is 23.4 seconds (130% base). If you refresh at <=5.4 seconds (30% base) you will never exceed the 23.4 second cap. If you refresh at >5.4 seconds, you exceed 23.4 seconds and anything over that gets wasted. Say you refresh at 10 seconds remaining, 10+18=28. You've wasted 28.5-23.4=5.1 seconds.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Cooldowns</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/80240-havoc">Havoc</a> - A 10 second debuff that causes all your single target spells to also strike the affected target. Note that Havoc only deal 60% damage so you should avoid casting Havoc on the priority target. Try use this on cooldown but make sure you have stored up 2-3 Soul Shards and atleast 1 stack of Conflagrate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1122/summon-infernal">Summon Infernal</a> - Summon an infernal for 30 seconds, while your infernal is up you generate 1 Soul Shard Fragment every 0.5 seconds.</p>
