<h2>Spec Mechanics</h2>

<p>Destruction Warlocks main ressource is Soul Shards but unlike Affliction and Demonology our soul shards are actually split up into 10 fragments. That means you need to generate 10 Soul Shard Fragments in order to have a full Soul Shard you then can spend on something.</p>

<h3>Generators</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/348-immolate">Immolate</a> - Applies a debuff to your target that deals damage over 18 second. Periodic damage generates 1 Soul Shard Fragment and has a 50% chance to generate an additional 1 on critical strikes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/17962-conflagrate">Conflagrate</a> - Instant cast that deals damage and generates 3 Soul Shard Fragments. This also grants you 1 stack of Backdraft (2 if specced Flashover).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/29722-incinerate">Incinerate</a> - Main generator and filler spell that generates 2 Soul Shard Fragments and an additional 1 on critical strikes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1122/summon-infernal">Summon Infernal</a> - Our main damage cooldown can now also be considered a generator. While your infernal is active you will generate 1 Soul Shard Fragment every 0.5 seconds.</p>

<h3>Spenders</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116858-chaos-bolt">Chaos Bolt</a> - Primary Soul Shard spender. Costs 2 Soul Shards, is a relatively long cast but also deals a large amount of damage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5740-rain-of-fire">Rain of Fire</a> - Our main AoE spell, costs 3 Soul Shards and deals damage over 8 seconds at a targeted location.</p>

<h3>Cooldowns</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/80240-havoc">Havoc</a> - A 10 second debuff that causes all your single target spells to also strike the affected target. Note that Havoc only deal 60% damage so you should avoid casting Havoc on the priority target. Try use this on cooldown but make sure you have stored up 2-3 Soul Shards and atleast 1 stack of Conflagrate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1122/summon-infernal">Summon Infernal</a> - Summon an infernal for 30 seconds, while your infernal is up you generate 1 Soul Shard Fragment every 0.5 seconds.<
