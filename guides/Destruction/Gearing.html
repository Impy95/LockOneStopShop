<h2>What does this stat do?</h2>
<p>Haste - Haste is your strongest stat as a Destruction Warlock. Haste makes everything faster, most importantly reducing the cooldown on conflagrate.</p>
<p>Crit - Incinerate and Immolate both generate more shards from critical strikes. Also your Critical Strike makes your Chaos Bolt hit harder as this spell is a guaranteed crit already.</p>
<p>Versatility - A weaker, but entirely passive, version of mastery.</p>
<p>Mastery - Passively increases your damage and reduces your damage taken, in addition to a random component. In 7.2.5 they made mastery considerably less RNG, most of it's value is now passive.</p>
<p>Obviously the precise stat weights are gonna vary a lot depending on your gear, talents and obviously the fight itself. This segment of the guide is just made to give you a general idea of what stats you should be aiming for.</p>

<u><h1>Gearing</h1></u>

<br>
<p>
Because there is not really a set "best in slot" list these days with the continuation of the Titanforging system your best bet would be to use our auto sorting gearlist.<br>
We are currently working to get the gearlist working the best it possibly can. This can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBZmhTfenYt9UdDX2B_BeuWpi4oauHg7oHdNElmM6Gg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here using this spreadsheet</a> which also includes a handy video presentation on how to use it to find out gearing options for Uldir.

<h2><u>Azerite Traits</u></h2>
<p>
    To view all information about relics please visit the <a href="#/Destruction/Sims/Azerite" target="_blank">Sims > Azerite page here.</a>
</p>
<p>Blizzard is still constantly tuning Azerite Traits and will likely continue to into the first few weeks of BfA. Right now, the standouts of the class-specific traits are:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=277706" target="_blank">Crashing Chaos</a> - Gives immense ST burst. Lacks on fights with adds or where you need consistent damage instead of burst damage. Generally only use this trait for ST bosses, or if the boss has a damage increase at some point.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278747/rolling-havoc" target="_blank">Rolling Havoc</a> - Great for situations where you can constantly get value from Havoc.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>There are several very powerful traits that only deal damage to one target, and thus are only really powerful for Single Target. Listed from strongest to weakest: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280380/thunderous-blast" target="_blank">Thunderous Blast</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280559/laser-matrix" target="_blank">Laser Matrix</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280284/dagger-in-the-back" target="_blank">Dagger in the Back</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273153/rezans-fury" target="_blank">Rezan's Fury</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280402/tidal-surge" target="_blank">Tidal Surge</a>, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273834/filthy-transfusion" target="_blank">Filthy Transfusion</a>.
</p>
<p>The following traits are all pretty decent and good in any situation: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278748/chaotic-inferno" target="_blank">Chaotic Inferno</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279913/bursting-flare" target="_blank">Bursting Flare</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273823/blightborne-infusion" target="_blank">Blightborne Infusion</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=281843/tradewinds" target="_blank">Tradewinds</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280429/swirling-sands" target="_blank">Swirling Sands</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280410/incite-the-pack" target="_blank">Incite the Pack</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273682/meticulous-scheming" target="_blank">Meticulous Scheming</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280598/sylvanas-resolve" target="_blank">Sylvanas' Resolve</a>, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=270583/champion-of-azeroth" target="_blank">Champion of Azeroth</a>. Tradewinds and Incite the Pack have added value from sims because they give your friends buffs.
</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, you should keep the highest item level item you have for each of the traits listed above. Tuning is still on-going, so which is best could change at any moment. For the immediate future, I'd aim for items with either Wracking Brilliance or Inevitable Demise, or if you can't get one of those, a generic stat proc.
