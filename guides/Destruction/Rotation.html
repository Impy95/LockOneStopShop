<h2>General Rotation</h2>

<em>Single Target Priority:</em>
<ol>
    <li>Maintain Immolate at all times.  If specced into Cataclysm, apply using that when available</li>
    <li>Chaos Bolt to avoid capping on Soul Shards</li>
    <li>If talented, Cataclysm on cooldown, unless you need to save it for burst AoE</li>
    <li>If talented, Channel Demonfire on cooldown</li>
    <li>If talented, Soul Fire on cooldown</li>
    <li>Chaos Bolt</li>
    <li>Conflagrate, you can save a charge of Conflagrate to use while moving, but never reach 2 charges.</li>
    <li>Incinerate</li>
</ol>

<em>Two Targets Priority:</em>
<ol>
    <li>Maintain Immolate at all times.  If specced into Cataclysm, apply using that when available</li>
    <li>Chaos Bolt to avoid capping on Soul Shards</li>
    <li>If talented, Cataclysm on cooldown, unless you need to save it for burst AoE</li>
    <li>If talented, cast Channel Demonfire on cooldown</li>
    <li>Use Havoc more or less on cooldown, make sure you have stacked up 2-3 Soul Shards and atleast 1 stack of Conflagrate ready for when this comes of cooldown.  Your goal during Havoc is to cast AT LEAST 3 Chaos Bolts and 2 Conflagrates.</li>
    <li>If talented, Soul Fire on cooldown</li>
    <li>Chaos Bolt</li>
    <li>Conflagrate, you can save a charge of Conflagrate to use while moving, but never reach 2 charges.</li>
    <li>Incinerate</li>
</ol>

<em>AoE:</em>
<p>Once you get into 3+ targets, there are tons of breakpoints and it makes it hard to say exactly what is the best thing to do at any given moment. Some general rules of thumb:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Rain of Fire does more damage than Chaos Bolt on 3 or more targets, assuming the mobs won't move out of it.</li>
    <li>Rain of Fire does more damage than Havoc Chaos Bolt on 5 or more targets, assuming the mobs won't move out of it.</li>
    <li>Immolate is worth maintaining on up to 8 targets, as long as they will live for more than 6 seconds.</li>
    <li>Maintaining Immolate is a lower priority on AoE than ST/2T. You should always make sure you're prioritizing your CDs and RoF/CB over Immolate for AoE.</li>
    <li>Havoc is worth using on 4 or fewer targets.</li>
    <li>If GoSup is talented and you're using Infernal on AoE instead of ST, hold your Havoc until the final 10 seconds of Infernal. During the first 20 seconds, you should be using Rain of Fire to spend as many shards as possible, stacking GoSup. Make sure you have at least a few shards going into the final 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, use Havoc and start spamming out Havoc Chaos Bolts.</li>   
    <li>On large AoE pulls Havoc can be used to generate shards for using Rain of Fire</li>         
</ol>

<em>Tips/Tricks:</em>
<ul>
    <li>The spells duplicated by your Havoc also generate Soul Shard Fragments. This means your Conflagrate casts grant you 1 full Soul Shard when cast during Havoc. You can use this, even on targets that are taking reduced damage, to gain more Shards for Chaos Bolts.</li>
    <li>The use of Cataclysm + Channel Demonfire on dungeon packs is incredibly strong. Make sure you pay attention to your cooldowns and dont waste one or the other seconds before they come off cd.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opener</h2>

<em>Single Target:</em>
<ol>
    <li>Pre-pot and cast an Incinerate when there's 3 seconds left on the pull-timer</li>
    <li>If you're talented into Cataclysm use this to apply Immolate, if not then manually cast Immolate to land as the boss is pulled</li>
    <li>Cast Conflagrate</li>
    <li>Cast your Summon Infernal</li>
    <li>Start generating Soul Shards without capping, if you're about to cap cast a Chaos Bolt</li>
    <li>When there's roughly 20 seconds left of your Summon Infernal duration, cast your Dark Soul: Instability aswell as any on-use trinkets you have</li>
    <li>Fit as many Chaos Bolts into this 20 second uptime while generating shards with Incinerate and Conflagrate and spending Backdraft stacks on Chaos Bolts</li>
</ol>
