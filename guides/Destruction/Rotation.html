<h2>General Rotation</h2>

<em>Single Target:</em>
<ul>
    <li>Maintain Immolate, if specced use Cataclysm on cooldown to apply this. Unless you need to save this for something</li>
    <li>Cast Chaos Bolt to avoid capping on Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Always have atleast 1 stack of  Conflagrate on cooldown, try use the Backdraft stacks on casting Chaos Bolt</li>
    <li>If specced, cast Channel Demonfire on cooldown.</li>
    <li>If specced, cast Soul Fire on cooldown</li>
    <li>Fill with Incinerate</li>
</ul>

<em>Two Targets:</em>
<ul>
    <li>Maintain Immolate, if specced use Cataclysm on cooldown to apply this. Unless you need to save this for something</li>
    <li>Cast Chaos Bolt to avoid capping on Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Always have atleast 1 stack of Conflagrate on cooldown, try use the  Backdraft stacks on casting  Chaos Bolt</li>
    <li>Use Havoc more or less on cooldown, make sure you have stacked up 2-3 Soul Shards and atleast 1 stack of Conflagrate ready for when this comes of cooldown</li>
    <li>If specced, cast Channel Demonfire on cooldown</li>
    <li>If specced, cast Soul Fire on cooldown</li>
    <li>Fill with Incinerate</li>
</ul>

<em>Cooldowns:</em>
<ul>
    <li>Try to align your Summon Infernal and Dark Soul. Note you should only do this if you're not going to miss out on a use of Dark soul. If you are going to miss out then use Dark soul on Cooldown.</li>
    <li>Always try to use your  Backdraft stacks on  Chaos Bolt. This will overall grant you the highest reduction in cast time</li>
    <li>The spells duplicated by your  Havoc also generates Soul Shard Fragments. This means your Conflagrate casts grant you 1 full Soul Shard when cast during  Havoc. You can use this to get more shards for casting  Chaos Bolt</li>
    <li>The use of Cataclysm + Channel Demonfire on dungeon packs is incredibly strong. Make sure you pay attention to your cooldowns and dont waste one or the other seconds before they come off cd.</li>
</ul>
