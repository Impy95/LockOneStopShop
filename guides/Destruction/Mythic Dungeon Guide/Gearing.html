    <h2>Stats</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Stats for Destruction are very close together, even in AoE situations for M+.<br>
    This means when you are gearing for M+ you are safe to equip the gear with the <b>highest item level gear</b> for the most part.<br>
    This does not include trinkets and ring/neck slots.  Trinkets are covered further below.  For necks/rings your best bet is to sim yourself on <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.

    <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a>
    <p>Sephuz is the best single legendary in the game for M+ by a large margin and we will get into specific uses for it in the <a href="/#/Destruction/Mythic Dungeon Guide/Dungeon Tips" target="_blank">Dungeon Tips</a> section of the guide. This legendary in particular has incredible power assuming you can proc it, especially on short pulls or bosses. The best way to proc it is by using your Imp's dispel, Shadowfury, Infernal's stun or purge, Doomguard's interrupt, Fear, Banish and Arcane Torrent (if Blood Elf).<br>
    Keep the ring's proc effect on cooldown as much as possible without screwing up any CC order of the group.<br>
    Even if you're not able to proc the effect of the ring it has very strong stats for Destruction and should not be dismissed due to the lack of a direct damage bonus when you can't proc it. The passive 2% multiplicative haste on top of the natural stats of the ring are great!

    <h4>Good legendaries for trash</h4>
    The following legendaries are to be always used in combination with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> for trash:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151821-the-master-harvester" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">The Master Harvester</span></a>: Useful in any situation with high shard turnover, especially with FnB, basically any trash pack.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/144369-lessons-of-space-time" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Lessons of Space-Time</span></a>: Less damage and less RNG than <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151821-the-master-harvester" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">The Master Harvester</span></a>. Use portals for the damage buff when you need it.  Remember to pool portals for bosses.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132460-alythesss-pyrogenics" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Alythess Pyrogenics</span></a>: Decent for heavy aoe but again generally worse than <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151821-the-master-harvester" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">The Master Harvester</span></a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Good legendaries for bosses</h4>
    Typically your best combination of legendaries you would use for raid for single target encounters will be best with the exception being when you can proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> and don't need the survival benefit of <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132444-prydaz-xavarics-magnum-opus" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus</span></a> on bosses such as Hyrja or Xakal as some examples on higher keys. Some other good legendaries to use in specific:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132379-sindorei-spite" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sindorei Spite</span></a>: The shorter the boss fight, the more potent these get as the 25s buff has higher overall uptime on shorter fights.  Combining LoF/Doomguard, Service imp, and 3x portals during the buff for massive single target burst.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/144369-lessons-of-space-time" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Lessons of Space-Time</span></a>: Already the best overall single target legendary, lessons gains even more value on short boss fights since you can pool 3 portals before the boss starts for higher overall portal uptime than you get on most raid bosses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Trinkets</h2>
    </div>

    <p>In general you are looking to bolster your static stats as much as possible throughout any dungeon. Some trinkets (or types of trinkets) you should be looking for are:
    <ul>
    <li>Stat sticks</li>
    <li>Stat proc trinkets</li>
    <li>Arcanocrystal</li>
    <li>Prototype Personnel Decimator (from Garothi Worldbreaker) - <i>Be careful when using this as it can and will randomly pull additional and possibly unwanted trash mobs</i></li>
	<li>Terminus Signaling Beacon (from High Command) - <i>This trinket is great for larger or shorter packs as well!</i></li>
    </ul>
