    <p>There is only one option in this tier: <b>Backdraft</b>.</p>

    <p>The choice in this set of talents comes down to either Eradication or Empowered Life Tap:
    <ul>
    <li>Eradication is only good in single target or 2 target scenarios which are the vast minority of pulls in Mythic+.  Consider Eradication ONLY for extremely difficult Tyrannical bosses.</li>
    <li>Empowered Life Tap is by far the best talent for the vast majority of Mythic+ scenarios.  It is a 10% damage bonus to all our non-pet spells, it is the best talent for aoe and only a small loss on single target.</li>
    </ul>
    Reverse Entropy is worse in every situation and should never be taken.
    </p>

    <p>For this set of talents you are again basically choosing between two talents as one of them is not a very viable option, explained below:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Shadowfury is one of the major advantages destro offers over Affliction in Mythic+.  A 4s ranged aoe stun on a 30s CD is extremely useful on a wide variety of pulls even though the cast time makes everyone sad.  This is your default talent unless avoiding a mechanic with DC is vital to the success of the run. Shadowfury is also your main way of proccing <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> in Mythic+.</li>
    <li>Demonic Cirlce also is used fairly often depending on the dungeon and most especially during weeks with Tyrannical on a few specific dungeons: Upper Kara for Medivh's Inferno Bolt, Arcway for Nartila's web and Darkheart Thicket for Xavius' Nightmare Bolt.</li>
    <li>Mortal Coil while it does have synergy with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> is not a good option as it fears the mob in random directions and out of the group's normal AoE.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="center">

    </div>

    <p>Fire and Brimstone is almost always the go to choice for this set of talents.<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Cataclysm has some use for burst AoE but in general the damage is just not significant enough to compete with FnB in most scenarios.</li>
    <li>Fire and Brimstone is the bread and butter of Destro in Mythic+, the cleave is substantial damage on it’s own and the additional shards allows you to quickly build and maintain Rain of Fire stacks in AoE situations.  You should almost always take FnB in Mythic+ unless you really need the additional boss damage from Soul Harvest.</li>
    <li>Soul Harvest is the best single target talent but offers little added trash damage.  It’s only about 5% ahead of Fire and Brimstone on single target which is a big deal for raid bosses but not so much for dungeon bosses.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="center">

    </div>

    <p>Burning Rush is your general go-to for this tier as it provides you with the desired movement required for a very little in return.<br>
    Dark Pact is a very good defensive cooldown especially for bosses that cast very large and very predictable hits. Some examples of this would be Lady Hatecoil in Eye of Azshara, Hyrja in Halls of Valor or Xavius in Dark Heart Thicket. <i>If you dismiss your pet prior to using Dark Pact it makes the shield based on your own health pool resulting in very very big shields</i><br>
    Demonskin has very limited use as if you are taking a more defensive option in this tier as the damage reduction is not an immediate surge of required healing/etc. There are some very small cases where Demonskin can be used where it is possible for you to die to trickling damage or where you could potentially die to overkill which can occur more frequently than Dark Pact's cooldown.

	<p>Grimoire of Supremacy and Grimoire of Service are generally close together in value for Mythic+.  Their uses are explained a little bit more below:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Grimoire of Supremacy gives you some more utility compared to using just an Imp. Infernal offers some extra AoE damage and an extra short aoe stun.  Doomguard brings an interrupt on a 24s CD</li>
	<li>Grimoire of Service is your general goto talent as imp does significant damage on its own (though it doesn’t cleave), and service imp can be useful for bursting down bigger mobs.</li>
	<li>Grimoire of Sacrifice is never taken as the added damage simply does not offset the utility of demons in Mythic+.</li>
	</ul>

    <p>This set of talents comes down to Channel Demonfire and Soul Conduit.  Channel Demonfire will generally see more use but their benefits will be explained a bit more below:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Channel Demonfire offers reliable single target and AOE which leads this to be our general go to talent.</li>
	<li>Soul Conduit becomes better when you are able to use RoF more often.  For example during teeming weeks when there is more trash to kill.  It is generally overshadowed by Channel Demonfire however but can see some use in specific situations.</li>
	</ul>
	Wreak Havoc should never be taken in Mythic+.
