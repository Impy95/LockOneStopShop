    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
   This is a fairly straightforward priority cleave encounter nearly perfectly suited to affliction's strengths.  The adds that spawn will heal each other so are typically tanked together away from the boss.  This allows you to funnel single target into the boss by maintaining Agony on the adds and dumping UAs and drains into the boss.  As this encounter is really a single target burn, you opt for the best single target talent, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=35195/siphon-life" target="_blank">Siphon Life</a>.  <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">Inevitable Demise</a> is the best trait by far for boss damage although all other traits remain strong as well.  <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196102/writhe-in-agony" target="_blank">Writhe in Agony</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196103/absolute-corruption" target="_blank">Absolute Corruption</a> also strong talent options that requires fewer globals for similar damage, especially with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278721/sudden-onset" target="_blank">Sudden Onset</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">Inevitable Demise</a> traits as GCDs can become an issue with so many Agony refreshes.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>
   
    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <li>Maintain Agony on all adds for shards and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">ID</a> stacks, it will not trigger <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=284459/zealotry" target=_blank">Zealotry</a>. </li>
    <li>With Agony on so many adds you will need to constantly dump UAs and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">ID</a> drains.  Not capping shards and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">ID</a> stacks is more important than using them at less than 4 shards or 45 stacks.  Spamming multiple UAs in a row to prevent shards from capping is fine.</li>
    <li>Face away from the crusader whenever he casts his ability or you will get disoriented; all your dots can be cast without facing your target.</li>
    <li>Pet choice is largely irrelevant.</li>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    The mythic version of this encounter is basically the same as heroic with two simple changes; one of the adds throws hammers at the raid that must be dodged, and the healing adds cast <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287419/angelic-renewal" target="blank">Angelic Renewal</a> that must be interrupted or the boss will heal to full.  
    <!--## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    
    <li>Use felhunter pet and a focus or mouseover macro to easily interrupt the add cast (/cast [@focus,harm] Spell Lock)</li>
	<li>You may need to manually switch targets with felhunter to interrupt if that adds are tanked too far away.</li>
