	<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
	<p>Kil'jaeden is a very long encounter on Mythic. Currently depending on your raids kill time you may be able to get 2 <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/224103-lord-of-flames?artifactRank=1">Lord of Flames</a> procs off. Try use this when your raid uses Bloodlust.</p>
	<p>This one is going to save your life and your dps a whole lot! Place your <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a> near the middle of the room, this means you can teleport onto your portal when the <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235059-rupturing-singularity">Rupturing Singularity</a> knocks you back. On mythic this knockback is very far and you will have it up for every single knockback in phase 1 and 2, not counting the intermission phases.</p>
	<p>Place your <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/111771-demonic-gateway">Demonic Gateway</a> in the middle of the room in the beginning of the fight. Then during the 40% shadow intermission you should place it going from Illidan to the bottom right corner of the platform. This will allow people in your raid to avoid one of the <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235059-rupturing-singularity">Rupturing Singularity</a> knockbacks in this phase. You should click the gateway when there is roughly 1 second left before the singularity explodes.</p>
	<p>In the final phase you should place your <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/111771-demonic-gateway">Demonic Gateway</a> from the middle to the edge of the <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/239214-tear-rift">Rift</a> to the middle of the platform. This will allow people in your raid to dip into the rift and teleport back out when the boss is casting <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/238999-darkness-of-a-thousand-souls">Darkness of a Thousand Souls</a> reducing the overall damage your raid is going to take in this phase.</p>
