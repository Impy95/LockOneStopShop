	<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
	<p>This fight is 100% singletarget and doesn't have a lot of mechanics. This means wether you're doing high dps or not depends on how you manage your cooldowns and deal with your downtime. You can help a lot of this by utilizing your <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a> however this can be difficult since you dont know exactly where the boss is going to spawn pillars. My advice is to place it in the back of where your raid is standing at max distance of the boss.</p>
	<p>Depending on your killtime it might be worth to save your second <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196098-soul-harvest">Soul Harvest</a> and lign it up with your 3-minute cd's. Note this is only really relevant when using <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132379-sindorei-spite" target="_blank"<span style="color: #ff8000">Sin'dorei Spite.</a></p>
