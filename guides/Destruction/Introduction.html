<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Welcome to my Destruction Warlock guide! My name is Loozy and i thought i'd start this off by telling you a little bit about myself so you know who i am and where i come from before you start reading. As said, i go by the name Loozy and i've been playing warlock ever since Siege of Orgrimmar. This is also the first raid i really cleared and the tier i started actually playing some decent level PVE. Currently i'm raiding in the guild Scrubbusters on The Maelstrom EU, but some of the previous guild's i've been in include Danish Terrace and Method. Also i'm the author of both the wowhead and Lockonestopshop Destruction Warlock guides.</p>
