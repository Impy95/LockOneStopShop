    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
   This is a single target encounter with some damage immune adds.  Inevitable Demise gains a ton of value on this fight since you can maintain agony on the spark bots nearly the entire fight for ID stacks.  Since incoming damage is quite high and movement is minor throughout the encounter, either defensive talent will be more valuable than Burning Rush.  Writhe in Agony can be considered over Siphon Life if you find youself running out of globals to maintain agony on the spark bots and dump ID stacks without overcapping.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>

    <li>This fight can be quite healing intensive in the last phase, don't be afraid to blow low ID drains to help with healing.</li>
    <li>With agony on so many adds you will need to constantly dump UAs and ID drains.  Not capping shards and ID stacks is more important than using them at less than 4 shards or 45 stacks.<li>
    <li>A typical strategy for handling spark bots is to root them; roots have a damage threshold to break and since the spark bots take 99% reduced damage agony will not break roots.<li>
    <li>Gateway and Circle are both very useful for running Gigavolt charges behind walls and returning to the group.<li>
    <li>Imp is the pet of choice since the boss jumps around a lot.<li>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    The mythic version of this encounter is basically the same as heroic except the spark bots reflect damage, players get Enormous as well as Shrunk, and everything has more health and does more damage as usual.  Spells with no initial damage do not trigger the damage reflect, so you are still free to maintain agony on the spark bots for ID stacks.  Defensive talents are highly recommended for progress.
