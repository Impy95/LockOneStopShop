    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
     This is a multi-phased encounter with a mix of single target and spread cleave.  Phase 1 is largely a single target burn of the two phase one bosses while ocasionally dealing with a Siren while Brother Joseph is on your boat.  Phase 2 is a spread cleave phase with adds spawning at range that must be slowed and bursted down. Siphon Life is generally the best although Writhe in Agony is also strong especially in slower kills where adds live longer.  All of your standard cleave-centric azerite traits are strong, Inevitable Demise is useful for quickly bursting adds.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>

    <li>Maintain dots on all targets and focus the sirens and storm elementals as needed until you or the raid leader decide to burn the boss.</li>
    <li>Make sure to refresh dots on the boss before add spawns to minimize dot downtime. <li>
    <li>You should use imp for this encounter to help with swapping between adds and boss. If you're in desperate need of a slow for the storm elementals the succubus has a 30% slow.<li>
    <li>Gateway can be placed either to move across the platform to dodge Sea Swells and soak Ire's of the Deep. </li>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    The major difference in the mythic version of this encounter is that the phase 1 mechanics continue into phase 2, namely the siren spawns.  This turns a primarily single-target burn into a heavily multi-target phase so Siphon Life loses a lot of value as there are simply too many targets to adequately maintain it on, thus Writhe in Agony becomes the best option both for maximizing add and boss damage.
