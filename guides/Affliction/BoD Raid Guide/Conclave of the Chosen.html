    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
   This is a single target priority burn encounter with some add spawns.  There are always 2 bosses present until the end of the encounter however the second boss heals to full when the first dies so multidotting for damage is entirely useless although there is no downside to maintaining agony on all bosses for shards and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">ID</a> stacks. On account of all the globals required to maintain Agony on both bosses and adds <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196102/writhe-in-agony" target="_blank">Writhe in Agony</a> is the talent of choice although <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=35195/siphon-life" target="_blank">Siphon Life</a> is also competetive.  <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">Inevitable Demise</a> is your best azerite trait here as it offers the most single target priority damage given all the additional targets, a single <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278721/sudden-onset" target="_blank">Sudden Onset</a> adds some damage to add spawns especially since you are running Writhe, and all the other usual strong traits remain good options.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>
   
    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->

    <li>Raptors should die fairly quick so you won't be able to deal all that much damage to them.  Dot them with agony and UA and if they become an issue use additional dots, UAs, and drain if needed.</li>
    <li>Shadowfury can be used to stun the raptor adds.</li>
    <li>Make sure to refresh dots on the boss before add spawns to minimize dot downtime. </li>
    <li>Use Imp for this fight as the targets move around a lot and there is nothing to interrupt.</li>
    <li>Gateway and Circle can be used to move across the room to Paku positions, although since his spawns are random these might be useless. </li>

    The mythic version of this encounter is basically a beefed up version of heroic and very little changes for Affliction.
