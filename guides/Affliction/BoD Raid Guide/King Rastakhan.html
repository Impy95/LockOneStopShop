    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
   This is a primarily single target multi-phase encounter that begins with 2 adds before the boss, King Rastakhan, becomes attackable.  Bwonsamdi spawns once the phase 1 adds die and you can maintain Agony on him for shards and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">ID</a> stacks (although he absorbs all damage).  When Rastakhan hits 60% phase 3 begins and much of the raid will go into a death realm (aka "downstairs") to burst Bwonsamdi to 50% hp when phase 4 begins.  A couple adds spawn in phase 4 although they are often just CC'd while you burn the boss.  Single target talents and traits are generally recommended here, although all level 30 talents are competetive options with different strengths; <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196102/writhe-in-agony" target="_blank">Writhe in Agony</a> frees some globals to make maintaining agony and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">ID</a> stacks easier at the cost of some single target damage, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196103/absolute-corruption" target="_blank">Absolute Corruption</a> allows you to continue damage Rastakhan while in the death realm bursting Bwonsamdi.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>
   
    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li>In phase 2 position yourself slightly outside Bwonsamdi's <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285190/aura-of-death" target="blank">Aura of Death</a> to easily maintain agony on him while continuing to single target Rastakhan.</li> 
    <li>Affliction is a mobile high single-target burst spec so is well suited to going into the death realm in phase 3, if you are assigned to this phase make absolutely sure to save Darkglare and Dark Soul: Misery to burst him in time.</li>
    <li>Pet choice is completely irrelevant here so long as it isn't Voidwalker; there are no interrupts, purges, dispels, slows, or target swaps required.</li>
    <li>Gateway and Circle can be used to maximize casting in phase 4 during Inevitable End.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    The mythic version of this encounter is basically a beefed up version of heroic and very little changes for Affliction.
    <!--## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li>Bwonsamdi's <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285190/aura-of-death" target="blank">Aura of Death</a> is significantly larger (45 yards) in mythic so dotting him for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">ID</a> stacks and shards in phase 2 requires additional movement and risk, however is generally still worthwhile.</li>
    </ul>
