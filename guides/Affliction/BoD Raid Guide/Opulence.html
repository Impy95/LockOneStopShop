    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
   This is a primarily single target encounter and single target traits and talents are preferred.  However you can dot both bosses at the start of phase 1 by throwing corruption on one and portal/gateway across the starting room to your assigned side, and Absolute Corruption will continue dealing damage to both bosses throughout the entire phase however the overall gain is minimal so this tactic is not generally recommended.  The gem of choice for this boss is Opal (left side, blue) unless you are assigned to Topaz or Ruby. As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>

    <li>You should hold Darkglare in phase 3 until the second add wave to maximize Opal benefit.</li>
    <li>Cast Seed of Corruption on the boss when adds are about to spawn to instantly tag every mob for Opal stacks, 2% per mob means each wave gives 16% added damage, after 2nd wave you will be at 36% bonus damage (p1 boss + opulence + 2x8 adds) and the cap is 40%.</li>
    <li>As affliction you are pretty useless at handling the p2 adds, if they're really an issue consider holding Phantom Singularity for the spawn (they are ~70s apart otherwise just agony them after seed for more ID stacks and shards.</li>
    <li>No pet utility is particularly useful here, pick your favorite.<li>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    In mythic you will get randomly swapped between rooms during phase 1, and after getting swapped you are immune to damage for 10 seconds so long as you don't move.  Be extremely careful to utilize this effect to avoid dying to Flame Jets and Flames of Punishment immediately after a swap.  Phase 1 lasts significantly longer in mythic (5+ mins) and getting everyone through alive will be drastically more difficult.  The Absolute Corruption tactic mentioned above is more relevant in mythic and also helps a bit with p2 adds.

    <li>You will almost certainly need to assist with interrupts so Felhunter is by far the favorite pet choice.</li>
    <li>The additional add spawns and time between spawns both work in ID's favor.<li>
