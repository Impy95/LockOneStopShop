    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
   This is a single target encounter with a single add that spawns at ~20s and then every minute thereafter.  Your usual single target setup will work perfectly here, although Inevitable Demise traits have some added utility both for add burst and healing which can get quite intense at times.  Affliciton isn't terribly useful at killing the adds outside ID drain dumps, but your overall damage should still be competetive on the encounter.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>

    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->

    <li>This fight can be quite healing intensive if the orb is managed poorly, don't be afraid to blow low ID drains to help with healing.</li>
    <li>Dark Pact almost perfectly aligns with the tantrums and can help alleviate a lot of the healing.</li>
    <li>Make sure to refresh dots on the boss before add spawns to minimize dot downtime. <li>
    <li>Demonic Circle can be used to quickly get out of fire puddles or get back from running the throw out of the group.</li>
    <li>Felhunter should be be used to assist with interrupts on the adds if needed, otherwise imp will provide the greatest target swap potential<li>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    The mythic version of this encounter is essentially the same as heroic except 2 adds spawn at the same time, but every 2 minutes instead of every 1 minute.  The damage is also significantly higher and the fight is frequently 6 healed to ease the pain so the above statements about defensive traits and talents are drastically more applicable in mythic.
    <!--## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    
    <li>You will almost certainly need to assist with interrupts so Felhunter is by far the favorite pet choice.</li>
    <li>The additional add spawns and time between spawns both work in ID's favor.<li>
