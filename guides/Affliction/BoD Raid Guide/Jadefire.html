    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
   This is a two target stacked cleave encounter with some add spawns and you will spend most of the fight focusing Mestrah / Ma'ra to prevent her final phase.  Siphon Life is the best talent in theory, however Writhe in Agony is quite close in damage, easier to play, and can even pull ahead with additional Sudden Onset traits.  Whatever azerite traits sim best for 2 targets should be sufficient for this encounter. As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>

    <li>Pretty much all the tigers and bombs die too quickly for you to really touch them as afflicition, you can agony and UA them for refunds and/or ID drain adds that live a while but otherwise focus on burning Mestrah / Ma'ra.</li>
    <li>Shadowfury can be used to stun the tiger adds.</li>
    <li>Use imp for this fight as the targets move around a lot and there is nothing to interrupt.<li>
    <li>You can gateway over significant portions of the maze without getting knocked back LINK POSITIONING BELOW</li>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    The mythic version of this encounter is identical to heroic except that you are nearly guarenteed to be ported up to the minigame and thus spend a decent amount of time unable to reapply dots to the boss. As a result, Absolute Corruption becomes the talent of choice although Writhe in Agony remains a strong option for a bit more work.
    <!--## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <li>All adds have more health in mythic so hard swapping with more dots and UAs than heroic is likely necessary.<li>
    <li>The order for the minigame is always Blue -> Green -> Red -> Green -> Blue.<li>
