    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
     This is a multi-phased primarily single target encounter with some priority add burns.  Phase 1 is pretty much entirely single target as adds are either Mind Controlled off the boat or obliterated before you can deal any significant damage to them.  Phase 2 has more targets, namely ice blocks and ordinances that must be burned. Frozen ordinances can be used to generate shards and ID stacks with agony.  Phase 3 is 3 separate burst adds (Wall, Natahanos, Tidewater Elemental).  Phase 4 is a single target burn with ranged priority adds (Prismatic Images), and ice blocks. Since most adds will not live long enough for agony to ramp, Siphon Life is the go-to talent.  Inevitable Demise is useful for quickly bursting ordinances, ice wall, tide elemental, and prismatic images, otherwse normal single-target traits take priority.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>

    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->

    <li>Maintain dots on all targets and focus the sirens and storm elementals as needed until you or the raid leader decide to burn the boss.</li>
    <li>Shadowfury can be used to stun the raptor adds.</li>
    <li>You should use imp for this encounter to help with swapping between adds and boss. If you're in desperate need of a slow for the storm elementals the succubus has a 30% slow.<li>
    <li>Gateway can be quite useful in p1 to clear fire on far ballistas, and in p2 and p3 to reposition around icy patches and get to ordinances and images. </li>
