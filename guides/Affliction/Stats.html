  <ul>
      <li>Intellect: Increases spell power and overall damage output.</li>
      <li>Haste: Decreases the period between DOT ticks, decreases our channel time and cast time, and decreases our GCD.</li>
      <li>Mastery: Increases the damage done by Corruption, Unstable Affliction, Agony and Siphon Life.</li>
      <li>Critical Strike: Gives our abilities the chance to deal double damage. This is amplified by Perdition.</li>
      <li>Versatility: Increases our damage and healing by a flat %, and decreases our damage taken by a flat %.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Affliction stats are fluid.</h2>
  <p>Affliction is an extremely multi-faceted spec, and your stats will change in value based on the type of content you're running, and the talents you pick. It's important to understand WHY and WHEN a stat is good for affliction.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Haste makes everything but cooldowns faster. It's the best source of throughput for seed of corruption spamming. It makes your agonies ramp up faster when target swapping regularly. It's also good for increasing your ST burst by making your UAs faster. This makes haste an ideal stat for fights with lots of target swapping or AoE, and Mythic+ in general.</li>
      <li>Mastery makes your DoTs hit like a truck. Plain and simple. Mastery is king on fights where an unusually large portion of your DPS is Agony/Corruption/Siphon Life/Unstable Affliction. Think fights like Demonic Inquisition and Desolate Host, where over 90% of your dps can be from DoTs.</li>
      <li>Crit gives you big numbers more often. It's the primary method of scaling Soul Flame damage. Affliction has a crit steroid in the form of an artifact trait, <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199158-perdition?artifactRank=1" target="_blank">Perdition.</a> With 3 relics, you can get up to 46% critical strike damage during <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216698-reap-souls" target="_blank">Reap Souls</a>.</li>
      <li>Versatility is sort of the red-headed stepchild of WoW. If your spec likes versatility, it usually means something is very wrong with its design.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>General Guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>ST and Council: Mastery</li>
      <li>Lots of small quickly dying adds: Haste</li>
      <li>Lots of Soul Flame damage (think Skorpyron): Crit</li>
  </ul>

      <h2>Pawn & Simming your character</h2>
  </div>
  For information on how to Sim your own character <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pW5mWY9nkfWoRCOHfoXqeeGb8s-jMoSVy-g8uveUv4c/preview" target="_blank">click here</a> and follow each step! Pawn is a useful tool you can use in game to help you decide on gear upgrades.
  It should not be used as gospel and when two pieces of gear are very similar in terms of "score" you should always sim them against each other.
