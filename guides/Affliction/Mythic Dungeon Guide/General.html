    <p>Your talents will change depending on several factors: dungeon level, groupâ€™s gear, composition, how you do your pulls, dungeon, affixes, etc...<br>
    As an Affliction Warlock you should adapt to what your group needs since we are such a versatile spec (for example priority damage or blanket cleave).<br>
    Nothing is set in stone!

    <h3>Hard Tyrannical Bosses</h3>
    <x-talent talent="2130210" spec="Affliction"></x-talent>
    </div>
    <p>You have a few choices to make depending on your own preference or depending on the bosses throughout the dungeon you're in:<br>
    You can either play with Soul Harvest or Phantom Singularity and Demonic Embrace or Soul Conduit. You also have a choice between Burning Rush and Dark Pact but you should normally just play Burning Rush considering you are able to full heal with Drain Soul very easily.

    <h2>Pets!</h2>
    </div>
    <p>You will essentially choose your pet based on what utility is needed for your group:<br>
    If you need a stun: Infernal<br>
    If you need an interrupt: Doomguard<br>
    </p>
    <p>There may be situations where you will choose your pet based on how you can proc Sephuz. For example there are some mobs that are immune to stuns but can be interrupted or situations where there is nothing you can interrupt but you can stun the mobs.</p>
    <p>If, for some reason, the utility your pet can bring is not needed always keep in mind that Infernal does more damage when you have 1.6 or more targets but be careful and be sure to watch over your pet as you could pull additional mobs due to the radious of the AoE from Infernal or from a mob patrolling while your Doomguard sits in the back and casts.</p>
