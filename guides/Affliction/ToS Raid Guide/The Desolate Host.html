    <p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132378-sacrolashs-dark-strike" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sacrolash</span></a> is the obvious best legendary on this fight. For your second legendary, <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132394-hood-of-eternal-disdain" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Helm</span></a>, <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151821-the-master-harvester" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Chest</span></a>, and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151649-soul-of-the-netherlord" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Netherlord</span></a> are of similar value.

    <h2>Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start on the side you aren't assigned to (on mythic make sure you use life tap / burning rush to reduce your health down to 20% or so to prevent smart heals from pushing you over 50%). Apply Corruption via Seed of Corruption to the targets and then immediately use the font to go to your assigned side.</li>
      <li>Place your Demonic Circle wherever your guild has designated to clear <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/236459-soulbind" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF">Soulbind</span></a>.</li>
      <li>If you're in the Spirit Realm and a Blood DK is tanking for you, use Seed of Corruption as they Mass Grip the adds to apply Corruption to them all.</li>
      <li>Maintain Agony on as many targets as possible, but keep in mind the Soul Residues (little voidlings) often die too fast for Agony to be worth it on them.</li>
      <li>If you're in the Spirit Realm, make sure you save Soul Harvest on the pull until the adds have spawned.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mythic Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you're in the Corporeal Realm, talent Dark Pact so you don't get killed by <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235924-spear-of-anguish" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF">Spear of Anguish</span></a>.</li>
      <li>Warlocks can relatively easily get back to Corporeal Realm if hit by <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235924-spear-of-anguish" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF">Spear of Anguish</span></a> by spamming Life Tap. I'd also recommend getting a macro that cancels common healer HoTs.</li>
