    <h2>Talents</h2>
    <p>I recommend taking DE unless you're also running <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151649-soul-of-the-netherlord" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Soul of the Netherlord</span></a>. The end of the fight can get pretty hectic, especially on mythic.

    <h2>Legendaries</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132378-sacrolashs-dark-strike" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sacrolashs Dark Strike</span></a> is a staple for this fight. It's generally not more powerful than other legendaries for a 2T fight, but since you can't refresh corruption during <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/233441-bone-saw" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Bone Saw</span></a> and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235230-fel-squall" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Fel Squall</span></a> it gains additional value. On mythic it also provides a very useful slow for the adds.</br>
    Your second legendary is a toss up. There isn't much spike damage that can kill you so <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132444-prydaz-xavarics-magnum-opus" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Prydaz</span></a> isn't recommended. Any of the usual strong affliction legendaries will do.

    <h2>Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Place your Demonic Circle somewhere on the outside of the room, preferably on the side Atrigan is tanked on. This makes it easy to move <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/233431-calcified-quills" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF">Calcified Quills</span></a> and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/233983-echoing-anguish" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF">Echoing Anguish</span></a> away from other players.</li>
    <li>Make sure you refresh Agony right before <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/233441-bone-saw" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF">Bone Saw</span></a> and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235230-fel-squall" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF">Fel Squall</span></a> start to avoid it falling off or gaining extra torment.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to your <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/233894-suffocating-dark" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF">Suffocating Darkness</span></a> timers. Start moving just before it goes out so if it spawns under you you're already moving out of it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mythic Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Try to get corruption out on adds as soon as they spawn. Generally you'll be ignoring them after this, letting specs with better AoE take them down. Instead, focus your damage into the bosses.</li>
    <li>Apply agony to them if you aren't near shard cap. It's generally not going to be worth your time to apply agony if you already have 5 or more active, drain soul will give you more total dps.</li>
    <li>Delay your 2nd/3rd Soul Harvest uses if there are no adds active or if the boss will die before the next SH comes off CD. Try to line your last one up with adds near the end of the fight to maximize DE value.</li>
    </ul>
