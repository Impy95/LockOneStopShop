    <h2>Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Most guilds have no issues killing fish quickly, so you should focus your efforts on Boss Damage unless you notice the adds dying slowly.</li>
      <li>Delay your first Soul Harvest use of the fight until the first set of eels spawn. Agony them, pop SH, and go to town on the boss.</li>
      <li>Use your last Soul Harvest when the boss is nearing death to maximize the value of Death's Embrace.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mythic Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Place your Demonic Circle on the marker your assigned to soak a fish at.</li>
      <li>Affliction warlocks get the most value from fishes in the first set, the fifth set, or the sixth set. The seventh set is technically the best POTENTIAL dps, but it's hard to maintain a fish at the end of the fight.</li>
      <li>If you're dropping fishes via eel puddles, you'll need to stand in the puddles for a solid 2+ seconds before the fish drops.</li>
      <li>A lesser talked about issue on this fight is that eel puddles give you a debuff that reduces your chance to hit an enemy. This also applies to spell. Many people accidentally cast a UA in a puddle and then wonder why it's not applied to the boss. Avoid puddles when possible, and don't spend shards while in them.</li>
    </ul>
