    <h2>Talents</h2>
    <p>For heroic you generally just want to maximize your ST damage. On mythic, Writhe in Agony pulls ahead because of adds and excessive movement.

    <p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151649-soul-of-the-netherlord" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Netherlord</span></a> is recommended to help with the execute phase. <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132394-hood-of-eternal-disdain" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Helm</span></a>, <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132457-power-cord-of-lethtendris" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Belt</span></a>, and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151821-the-master-harvester" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Chest</span></a> are all good second choices.

    <h2>Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Place your Demonic Circle near where you normally stand. In case you're ever at risk of getting knocked off, use your Demonic Circle after the knockback starts.</li>
      <li>Place your Demonic Gateway between 2 corners of the room. Make sure you don't put it directly through the center; if you gateway through a center orb it one shots you. The ideal place is just slightly to the side of the center.</li>
      <li>Start precasting Seed of Corruption on the boss when the adds are ~2 seconds from spawning. This way, you apply corruption instantly to all 3.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mythic Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Warlocks can pretty easily take 2 debuffs during primary phases because of Drain Soul. However, ANYONE taking 2+ stacks during intermissions is sketchy.</li>
      <li>Make sure you cancel your burning rush if you have <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/243536-lingering-eruption" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF"></span>Lingering Eruption</a>. You need to run at base movement speed to spawn orbs in the correct way.</li>
    </ul>
