<p>
  <u><h3>Intellect</h3></u>
    Raw increase to all damage dealt.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Haste</h3></u>
    Makes all of the things faster. More casts/melees/ticks = More dps.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Mastery</h3></u>
  A large increase to the damage of all of your DoTs, as well as Seed of Corruption.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Critical Strike</h3></u>
  Critical Strikes deal twice the damage.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Versatility</h3></u>
  A relatively weak multiplier to all of your damage, as well as damage taken reduction.
</p>

<h2>General Priority:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mastery</li>
    <li>Intellect</li>
    <li>Haste</li>
    <li>Critical Strike</li>
    <li>Versatility</li>
</ul>
<p>For Single Target, you ideally want to keep haste and mastery relatively close in value. Haste can even pull ahead substantially if you have two <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=272891/wracking-brilliance" target="_blank">Wracking Brilliance</a> traits. However, Mastery pulls massively ahead of the other stats for cleave and aoe, which is why we rate it so highly.
</p>
<p>Intellect has a very high value compared to what you may be used to coming from Legion. In general, the highest ilevel item you have with mastery on it will be the best.
</p>
<p>
Because there is not really a set "best in slot" list these days with the continuation of the Titanforging system your best bet would be to use our auto sorting gearlist.<br>
We are currently working to get the gearlist working the best it possibly can. This can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBZmhTfenYt9UdDX2B_BeuWpi4oauHg7oHdNElmM6Gg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here using this spreadsheet</a> which also includes a handy video presentation on how to use it to find out gearing options for Uldir.

<h2><u>Azerite Traits</u></h2>
<p>To view sims about Azerite Traits please visit the <a href="#/Affliction/Sims/Azerite" target="_blank">Sims > Azerite page here.</a>
</p>
<p>Blizzard is still constantly tuning Azerite Traits and will likely continue throughout Uldir. Right now, the standouts of the class-specific traits are:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278721/sudden-onset" target="_blank">Sudden Onset</a> - Massively increases the damage Agony deals and also makes it start at 4 stacks.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=272891/wracking-brilliance" target="_blank">Wracking Brilliance</a> - A large intellect proc with a high uptime.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">Inevitable Demise</a> - Corruption ticks give you a stacking damage increase to Drain Life. Very powerful in Dungeons, where you can stack the buff to 100 before a boss for a large burst of damage.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275372/cascading-calamity" target="_blank">Cascading Calamity</a> - Reapplying Unstable Affliction before it expires gives you a haste buff. This one is only very powerufl for Single Target, but many fights in the raid are Single Target.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>There are several very powerful traits that only deal damage to one target, and thus are only powerful for Single Target. Listed from strongest to weakest: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280380/thunderous-blast" target="_blank">Thunderous Blast</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280559/laser-matrix" target="_blank">Laser Matrix</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280284/dagger-in-the-back" target="_blank">Dagger in the Back</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273153/rezans-fury" target="_blank">Rezan's Fury</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280402/tidal-surge" target="_blank">Tidal Surge</a>, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273834/filthy-transfusion" target="_blank">Filthy Transfusion</a>.
</p>
<p>The remaining good traits are all of the generic stat procs and a few others, including: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273823/blightborne-infusion" target="_blank">Blightborne Infusion</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=281843/tradewinds" target="_blank">Tradewinds</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280429/swirling-sands" target="_blank">Swirling Sands</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280410/incite-the-pack" target="_blank">Incite the Pack</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273682/meticulous-scheming" target="_blank">Meticulous Scheming</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280598/sylvanas-resolve" target="_blank">Sylvanas' Resolve</a>, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=270583/champion-of-azeroth" target="_blank">Champion of Azeroth</a>. Tradewinds and Incite the Pack have added value from sims because they give your friends buffs.
</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, you should keep the highest item level item you have for each of the traits listed above. Tuning is still on-going, so which is best could change at any moment. For the immediate future, I'd aim for items with either Wracking Brilliance or Inevitable Demise, or if you can't get one of those, a generic stat proc.
