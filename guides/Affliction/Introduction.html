	<p>Welcome to the Legion Affliction Guide. My name is Gahddo, or Gahhda, honestly who really knows. I raid with <a href="https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/burning-legion/HC" target="_blank"><span>HC - US Burning Legion</span></a>. I've been playing warlock since MoP. Funnily enough, I didn't reroll because I thought warlocks were FotM, I rerolled because I literally could not live without red T14 in my life. I also run <a href="https://discord.gg/0onXDymd9WnPQUE7" target="_blank"><span>the Warlock Discord</span></a>. You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/gahddo" target="_blank"><span>twitter</span></a>, but I mostly just complain about wow developers and political stuff.
  </p>
  <p>Special Shoutouts to: Pip, Xyronic, Yipz, all the mods of the warlock discord, and especially Terryn.</p>
  <p>Now that all that stuff is out of the way, actual guide:</p>
	
  <h2>Affliction's Strengths:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> Strong Single Target on fights with adds via <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199472-wrath-of-consumption" target="_blank">Wrath of Consumption</a> </li>
		<li> Extremely strong multi-dotting</li>
		<li> Incredible mobility with a large amount of our damage coming from instant cast dots.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Affliction's Weaknesses:</h2>
	<ul>
    <li> Has decent burst via UA spamming, but requires a bit of ramp time to get full damage going. </li>
		<li> Heavily balanced around adds. Affliction can be pretty mediocre on fights without adds or multiple bosses.</li>
    <li> Relatively low skillcap and high RNG means the spec is easy to pick up and master, but once you do it's a bit of gambling.</li>
	</ul>
  
  <h2>Abbreviations/Jargon/Lingo/Hipcooltalk</h2>
  <p>In case I forgot to expand anywhere, here's a list of things you might see me use later in the guide:</p>

    <li>BR = Burning Rush</li>
    <li>DE = Death's Embrace</li>

    <li>PS = Phantom Singularity</li>
    <li>SC = Soul Conduit</li>
    <li>SH = Soul Harvest</li>
    <li>SL = Siphon Life</li>
    <li>SoC = Seed of Corruption</li>
    <li>StS = Sow the Seeds</li>
    <li>UA = Unstable Affliction</li>
    <li>WiA = Writhe in Agony</li>
