  <p>Welcome to the Battle for Azeroth Affliction Guide. My name is Gahddo, or Gahhda, honestly who really knows. I raid with <a href="https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/burning-legion/HC" target="_blank"><span>HC - US Burning Legion</span></a>. I've been playing warlock since MoP. Funnily enough, I didn't reroll because I thought warlocks were FotM, I rerolled because I literally could not live without red T14 in my life. I also run <a href="https://discord.gg/blackharvest" target="_blank"><span>the Warlock Discord</span></a>. You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/gahddo" target="_blank"><span>twitter</span></a>, but I mostly just complain about wow developers and political stuff.
  </p>
  <p>Special Shoutout to all of the council in the Warlock Discord.</p>
  <p>Now that all that stuff is out of the way, the actual guide:</p>
	
  <h2>Affliction's Strengths:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Single Target damage</li>
      <li>Spread Cleave damage</li>
      <li>Extremely mobile</li>
      <li>Multiple strong Cooldowns</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Affliction's Weaknesses:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bad Area of Effect damage. Seed is very weak for a baseline AoE spell.</li>
      <li>Short-lived adds. You won't be doing much damage to things that live for less than 10 seconds or so. (E.g. Explosive Affix)</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Abbreviations/Jargon/Lingo/Hipcooltalk</h2>
    <p>In case I forgot to expand anywhere, here's a list of things you might see me use later in the guide:</p>
