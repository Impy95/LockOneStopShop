    <h2>Talents</h2>
    <p>This is the once-a-tier joke fight. It really doesn't matter what talents or legendaries or anything you take or do really. I recommend the following because it gives you permanent slow for adds while maintaining high ST for Obfuscators and Destructors.</p> 
    <x-talent talent="2233211" spec="Affliction"></x-talent>

    <h2>Legendaries</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132378-sacrolashs-dark-strike" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sacrolash</span></a> is obviously required for permanent 60% slow on adds. Most people run <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz</span></a> for their second legendary because you can proc it with Howl of Terror and Infernal Stun on Felhounds.</p>
    
    <h2>Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Don't scumbag. No one cares about Eonar rankings and the only thing that even remotely matters is damage to Obfuscators and Destructors.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <h2>Mythic Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>I've only ever done red crystal for <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/249121-final-doom" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF"></span>Final Doom</a>, so I can't really speak for how the other debuffs might change how you play. With red you basically just stand away from people and lose dps from getting knocked up.</li>
    </ul>
