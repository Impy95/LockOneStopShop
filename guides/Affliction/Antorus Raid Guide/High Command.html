    <h2>Talents</h2>
    <p>Everything on this fight depends heavily on where your guild needs you to do damage. I recommend this setup because it gets you the best possible damage TO THE ACTUAL BOSSES. If your guild needs you to do more damage to adds, run Sow the Seeds and Soul Conduit instead. AC is pretty competitive with Contagion for boss damage on Mythic. It will net you more add damage but less boss damage, slightly.</p>

    <h2>Legendaries</h2>
    <p><p>There are a wide variety of legendaries that give similar dps on this fight: <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132394-hood-of-eternal-disdain" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Helm</span></a>, <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132378-sacrolashs-dark-strike" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sacrolash</span></a>, <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132444-prydaz-xavarics-magnum-opus" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Prydaz</span></a>, <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz</span></a>. Prydaz is very powerful on this, healing gets very intense at points. Sephuz can be proc'd by interrupting Pyromancers, and is very strong even if you can't proc it. Sacrolash will give you the most damage to adds.</p>
    
    <h2>Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>There's a lot of small stuff you can do on this fight to optimize your dps, but it's important to keep in mind that if at any point you're feeling overwhelmed by the amount of decisions, just stop and drain the boss for a bit. Not killing your raid by standing in <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/245161-entropic-mine" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF"></span>Mines</a> is far more important than your dps, the check is very easy to meet.</li>
	<li>Because there is a lot going on in the fight, here are some ground rules: Never let Agony fall off the boss, Never cap shards, Try to damage every add at least once, Watch your feet.</li>
	<li>You can precast a Seed of Corruption as the adds are about to spawn to instantly apply Corruption.</li>
	<li>Only Agony adds if they'll live for more than 5 seconds.</li>
	<li>If you aren't capped on shards, try to Drain Soul any dying adds.</li>
	<li>If you have sephuz, try to interrupt Pyromancers.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <h2>Mythic Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The comments above about heroic apply to Mythic as well. DO NOT lose focus of <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/245161-entropic-mine" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF"></span>Mines</a> or <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/244729-shock-grenade" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF"></span>Grenades</a>. The check isn't very relevant.</li>
    <li>The primary change on Mythic is the Bats. Anytime someone is in a pod, bats will spawn periodically and channel a 10 second spell to try and knock them out of the pod. They don't have a lot of health, so they're amazing for affliction.</li>
	<li>Pay attention to how fast bats are dying in your group, and try to time a UA on each one that will still be up when the bat dies so you get the shard refunded and some extra UA damage.</li>
	<li>If your guild needs help killing Pyromancers and Felguards, You can run Absolute Corruption instead of Contagion with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132378-sacrolashs-dark-strike" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sacrolash</span></a> and increase your damage to them massively.</li>
