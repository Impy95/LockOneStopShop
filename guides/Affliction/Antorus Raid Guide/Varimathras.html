    <h2>Talents</h2>
    <p>Generic Single Target talents. On mythic, it's highly worth considering SC over SL. The adds on mythic give a ton of free shards which pump the value of SC up.</p> 
    <x-talent talent="3113212" spec="Affliction"></x-talent>

    <h2>Legendaries</h2>
    <p>This is just going to come down to the gear you have available. Varimathras is as close to patchwerk as you get this tier, so I recommend simming your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a> to figure out which legendaries will be the best for you.</p>
	It should be noted that on mythic the excess shards from Drain Souling adds reduce the value of <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132457-power-cord-of-lethtendris" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Belt</span></a>.
    
    <h2>Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>There's no real tips or tricks to give for this fight on heroic. You pretty much just sit there and hit buttons until the boss dies.</li>

    <h2>Mythic Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Pay close attention to the add timers. Try to dump your shards in such a way that you'll never cap from draining the adds and you won't have to interrupt an MG cycle to drain them. Because they live for such a short period, your damage is going to suck on them and you're best off just using Drain Soul on them to get more ST.</li>
    </ul>
