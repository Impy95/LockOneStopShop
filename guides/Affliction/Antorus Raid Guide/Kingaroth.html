    <h2>Talents</h2>
    <p>Generic Single Target talents. Mythic has quite a bit of movement, so you can opt for writhe without losing a ton of dps if you're not comfortable doing all of the mechanics and optimizing MG play during progression.</p> 
    <x-talent talent="3113212" spec="Affliction"></x-talent>

    <h2>Legendaries</h2>
    <p>Like a lot of the harder bosses this tier, I recommend using <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132444-prydaz-xavarics-magnum-opus" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Prydaz</span></a> on this fight. The dps check is a bit tighter on this one, but there's also just an absurd amount of damage going out throughout the entire fight.</br>
	For your second legendary, you'll probably get the most dps out of <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132394-hood-of-eternal-disdain" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Helm</span></a> or <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132457-power-cord-of-lethtendris" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Belt</span></a>. I recommend simming your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>You can place your Demonic Circle either where your group stacks during the primary phase, or on the robot platform you're assigned to.</li>
	<li>Place a Demonic Gateway between 2 of the robot platforms to aid in cleaning up leftover robots.</li>
	<li>Save your SH for robots. They have a ton of health, can easily wipe your raid if not killed in time, and have a large damage taken increase debuff. Also try to pool shards and souls before robots.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <h2>Mythic Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Really focus on reducing your movement for mythic. As a warlock, you should be able to stand closer to the tanks than everyone else in your raid. I'm not saying go stand on the tanks, but you can get much closer than the rest of your raid, giving everyone more space. I usually stand about half way between the raids stack point and the tanks.</li>
	<li>Your guild may ask you to go to a robot with tanks and without healers during robots. Pay close attention to if your tanks are popping bombs during the robots. You can usually stand in the green circles and just heal through it with Drain Soul, but you can easily get globaled if a bomb goes off near you after taking a circle.</li>
    </ul>
