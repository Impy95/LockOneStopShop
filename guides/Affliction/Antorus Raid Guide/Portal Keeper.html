    <h2>Legendaries</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz</span></a> is mandatory on this fight. You can proc it in tons of ways. Fearing/Howl of Terroring/Interrupting imps or interrupting the minibosses both work.</br> 
	For your second legendary, <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132394-hood-of-eternal-disdain" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Helm</span></a> and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132444-prydaz-xavarics-magnum-opus" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Prydaz</span></a> are both good.

    <h2>Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>If talented, try to time your PS around <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/244677-transport-portal" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF"></span>Transport Portal</a>. This should be relatively easy, the timers naturally line up well.</li>
	<li>You can proc sephuz by: Having your doomguard interrupt imps or minibosses, Fearing imps, and using Howl of Terror/Mortal Coil on imps.</li>
	<li>You don't always have to DoT every imp that spawns to get credit for killing them. If the imps are spawned closely together, you can just DoT one of them and Soul Flame will tag the rest. You should be trying to tag at least 5 per <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/244677-transport-portal" target="_blank"><span style="color: #66C4FF"></span>Transport Portal</a> for your Wrath of Consumption.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <h2>Mythic Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>On Mythic, the portal minibosses are massively harder to kill than heroic. If you're assigned to the portal group, you should run full ST burst talents (MG/Contagion/SH/SC). Eventually your guild may get to a point where you don't need to change your playstyle to kill the minibosses safely, but the fight has no real DPS checks outside of the minibosses.</li>
    </ul>
