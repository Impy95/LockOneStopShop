    <h2>Talents</h2>
    <p>The decently long-living adds make AC a staple on this fight. DE is the clear choice because most of your damage comes from Agony/Corruption.</p>

    <p>It's hard to beat <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132394-hood-of-eternal-disdain" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Helm</span></a> and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132378-sacrolashs-dark-strike" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sacrolash</span></a> on this fight. Some people have had success running SC with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151649-soul-of-the-netherlord" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Netherlord</span></a> instead of <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132394-hood-of-eternal-disdain" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Helm</span></a>, but there's a reason it's less represented in logs.</p>
    
    <h2>Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>Always try to refresh your Agonies on the active bosses right before adds spawn.</li>
    <li>If you stand in the very center of the room for lightning adds, you can dot all 4 of them. MAKE SURE NO ON ELSE IS THERE. If someone claims that spot, still try to be near the middle so you can get out at least corruption on all 4.</li>
	<li>You should be able to DoT 5 Fire adds easily from any point in the room. Make sure you figure out which ones you can hit from where you usually stand.</li>
	<li>If your guild stops killing adds at some point to burn the boss, it's worth it to maintain Agony on up to 3 adds for shard gen.</li>
	<li>Depending on how fast your adds die, particularly the fire adds, it's sometimes worth it to Corruption them first as Agony won't have sufficient ramp time.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <h2>Mythic Tips/Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>This is another fight that's pretty much the same as heroic. Don't be the guy who pads on adds that don't matter if your guild calls for you to ignore the adds and burn the boss.</li>
	<li>The dps check on the healing adds is a lot higher and you generally want to kill 2 at a time. Agony the 2 you aren't killing for extra shards and free ramp time.</li>
	</ul>
