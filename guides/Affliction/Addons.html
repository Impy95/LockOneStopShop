        <a href="http://www.tukui.org/dl.php" target="_blank">Elv UI</a> This is a great UI skin package, super clean, and very customizable. It also has a very nice module for customizing the boss unit frames for tracking dots easier.

        <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm9wozm92nqulph/DoomShards.zip?dl=0" target="_blank">Doom Shards</a> Handy UI for tracking shards and when you can expect a flood of shards. Has some "Rough predictions" of when you will likely get a shard from Agony. This version of Doomshards has been modified to work in tandem with the Soul Shard bit change that comes into effect in 7.2.5.

        As an alternative to DoomShards there is a new Weak Aura by an amazing coder named Ipse who is replicating the functionality of DoomShards into a Weak Aura aptly called Ipse Shards which can be found by clicking on the link above. He sometimes has testing builds available as well <a href="https://wago.io/BkmU1Vqmb" target="_blank">here</a>

    <h2>Macros</h2>
    </p>

    <p>If you would like to submit a macro for this section, please PM me on Discord.</p>
    How to make Demonic Circle work like PRE legion:<br>
    #showtooltip Demonic Circle<br>
    /cancelaura Demonic Circle<br>
    /cast Demonic Circle
    <p></p>

    <p>Cancel Burning Rush when stationary (IE: Draining) This will also work nicely with Unstable Affliction.<br>
    #showtooltip Drain Soul<br>
    /cancelaura Burning Rush<br>
    /cast Drain Soul</p>

    <p>Alt/Shift/Ctrl modifier focus macro. If you hold down the selected mod key, the macro will cast the spell at your focus rather than your current target.<br>
    #showtooltip Agony<br>
    /cast [mod:alt,@focus][] Agony</p>

    <p>Mouseover Dots<br>
    #showtooltip Agony<br>
    /cast [target=mouseover,harm][] Agony</p>
