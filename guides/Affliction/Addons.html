While there are many addons out there, there are certainly a few that stick out as great ones, here are some that I highly recommend:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/weakauras-2" target="_blank">Weak Auras 2</a>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            The quintessential addon for tracking anything and everything there is in World of Warcraft. There are many places that you can find Weak Auras including:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://wago.io" target="_blank">wago.io</a> has a variety of options that you can explore.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://wago.io/Sy5tNYrM7" target="_blank">This is Not's aura suite</a>, it has all specs included in one aura group.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://wago.io/Sy5tNYrM7" target="_blank">Kirin</a> has also made a set of his own.
                 <li>
                    <a href="https://wago.io/Sy5tNYrM7" target="_blank">Ipse</a> has always made a great set of auras for Warlock.
                </li>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/azeroth-auto-pilot" target="_blank">Azeroth Auto Pilot</a>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            This leveling addon has been vetted by numerous "speed levelers" and even I have used it multiple times to assist in the leveling process. A great way to figure out where to go and when without thinking about it at all!
        </div>
    </li>
        <li>
        <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auto-loot-plus" target="_blank">Auto Loot Plus</a>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
            Another leveling/general purpose addon that speeds up the looting process. How fast does it speed it up? It makes looting nearly instant, you'll basically never see the loot window.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://wago.io/IpseShards" target="_blank">Ipse Shards</a>
        <div style="margin-left:40px">
        DoomShards unfortunately has not worked properly since sometime in Legion, however there is a new Weak Aura by an amazing coder named Ipse who is replicating the functionality of DoomShards into a Weak Aura aptly called Ipse Shards which can be found by clicking on the link above. He sometimes has testing builds available as well <a href="https://wago.io/BkmU1Vqmb" target="_blank">here</a>
