        <p><strong>Tier 15:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108558/nightfall" target="_blank">Nightfall</a>:</u></strong> An RPPM proc that causes your next Shadow Bolt to be instant and deal 25% more damage.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=198590/drain-soul" target="_blank">Drain Soul</a>:</u></strong> Replaces Shadow Bolt as your filler. Deals double damage to enemies below 20% health, and if a target dies while being Drained it generates a Soul Shard.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=264106/deathbolt" target="_blank">Deathbolt</a>:</u></strong> A 30 second cooldown which deals damage equal to 30% of your DoTs' remaining damage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Raiding:</strong> Nightfall and Drain Soul are both incredibly weak at current tuning. You're always going to be using Deathbolt right now.</p>
    <p><strong>Mythic+:</strong> Similar to raiding, except Drain Soul has some small potential use during Explosive Affix weeks. Generally always Deathbolt.</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 30:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196102/writhe-in-agony" target="_blank">Writhe in Agony</a>:</u></strong> Causes Agony to stack up to 5 additional times, making the cap 15 stacks up from 10.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196103/absolute-corruption" target="_blank">Absolute Corruption</a>:</u></strong> Makes Corruption permanent (24 seconds in PvP) and makes it do 15% more damage.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=35195/siphon-life" target="_blank">Siphon Life</a>:</u></strong> Adds another maintenance DoT to the rotation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Raiding:</strong> Siphon Life for Single Target, Writhe in Agony for cleave. Absolute Corruption can beat Writhe in Agony on fights where there are many targets up frequently.</p>
    <p><strong>Mythic+:</strong> Absolute Corruption until you get one or more <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278721/sudden-onset" target="_blank">Sudden Onset</a> traits. Once you have 1 or more SO, WiA is generally better.</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 45:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=219272/demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a>:</u></strong> Causes your Soul Leech to passively regen over time, and increases its cap to 15% of your max HP.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=111400/burning-rush" target="_blank">Burning Rush</a>:</u></strong> Run fast, kill yourself. Healers hate this. Warlocks love it.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108416/dark-pact" target="_blank">Dark Pact</a>:</u></strong> Big bubble on a relatively small cooldown.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Raiding:</strong> Demon Skin provides a large increase to your self healing. Dark Pact is better in situations where you're taking bursts of damage every 60+ seconds or need to soak things. You can opt into Burning Rush if you feel you need the mobility more than self-healing.</p>
    <p><strong>Mythic+:</strong> The only change from Raiding is that Burning Rush has more value in M+, where mobility is generally more relevant than raids. For low keys where you're moving through packs quickly, BR may be better. For high keys you're usually better off with a defensive talent.</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 60:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196226/sow-the-seeds" target="_blank">Sow the Seeds</a>:</u></strong> Allows your Seed to embed in 1 additional nearby target per cast.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=205179/phantom-singularity" target="_blank">Phantom Singularity</a>:</u></strong> A powerful 45 second cooldown.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=278350/vile-taint" target="_blank">Vile Taint</a>:</u></strong> A shorter cooldown meant to act as an AoE Unstable Affliction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Raiding:</strong> Always Phantom Singularity. The other talents don't bring much to raids, while Phantom Singularity is perfect for most situations in raids.</p>
    <p><strong>Mythic+:</strong> Phantom Singularity is usually the best. Vile Taint is slightly better for AoE, but considerably weaker for bosses.</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 75:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=264874/darkfury" target="_blank">Darkfury</a>:</u></strong> Reduces the cooldown of Shadowfury.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6789/mortal-coil" target="_blank">Mortal Coil</a>:</u></strong> Single Target horrify that also heals you.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=268358/demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a>:</u></strong> Place a circle on the ground, use it later to instantly travel up to 40 yards.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Raiding:</strong> Demonic Circle is going to be the best on most raid fights, as it provides a massive amount of mobility. Mortal Coil is useful on fights that have very high healing requirements, or where you don't need the mobility of Demonic Circle.</p>
    <p><strong>Mythic+:</strong> Mortal Coil and Darkfury are both powerful options. Which you choose will depend on your group comp, the dungeon you're running, and the affixes. Demonic Circle has some niche uses in dungeons.</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 90:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=32388/shadow-embrace" target="_blank">Shadow Embrace</a>:</u></strong> Causes Shadow Bolt to apply a stacking maintenance debuff. Each stack increases damage dealt to the target by 3%.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=48181/haunt" target="_blank">Haunt</a>:</u></strong> A short cooldown which deals a moderate amount of damage and applies a debuff, causing the target to take 10% increased damage from all of your spells. If the target dies while the debuff remains, the cooldown is reset.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=159024/grimoire-of-sacrifice" target="_blank">Grimoire of Sacrifice</a>:</u></strong> Causes ALL spells to have an RPPM-based chance to deal an additional hit of Single Target damage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Raiding:</strong> Haunt. The other talents are numerically bad.</p>
    <p><strong>Mythic+:</strong> Haunt. The other talents are numerically bad.</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 100:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=215941/soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a>:</u></strong> Gives every Soul Shard you spend a 15% chance to refund itself.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=264000/creeping-death" target="_blank">Creeping Death</a>:</u></strong> Reduces the tick time and duration of all of your maintenance DoTs. It should be noted that this does not increase your Shard Generation. When talented, it reduces the amount of Shards you gain per tick of Agony by 15%. Because this reduces the duration of your DoTs, it also means you have to refresh at a shorter duration for pandemic.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=113860/dark-soul-misery" target="_blank">Dark Soul Misery</a>:</u></strong> An extremely powerful 2 minute cooldown.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Raiding:</strong> Dark Soul: Misery is just too powerful in raids to consider the other talents. It's far ahead in terms of raw dps and also gives you controlled burst.</p>
    <p><strong>Mythic+:</strong> Creeping Death has a larger role than in Raids, but is still usually worse than Dark Soul: Misery; It provides higher sustained AoE, so consider using it on Teeming or Fortified weeks.</p>
