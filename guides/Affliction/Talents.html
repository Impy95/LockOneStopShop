        <p><strong>Tier 15:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48181-haunt" target="_blank">Haunt</a>:</u></strong> Deals a small amount of damage, increases the damage you deal to the target by a small amount, and resets if the target dies during the debuff.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196102-writhe-in-agony" target="_blank">Writhe in Agony</a>:</u></strong> Best for fights with regular 2+ targets or high movement.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/235155-malefic-grasp" target="_blank">Malefic Grasp</a>:</u></strong> Best for ST fights, and fights where your add damage doesn't matter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> MG is a solid 4-6% ahead of Writhe for ST low movement fights. ToS has a pretty even split between fight styles, lots of ST fights and lots of fights with adds or high movement. Haunt is generally not used. Its niche isn't one that's very relevant for an aflfiction warlock.</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 30:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196105-contagion" target="_blank">Contagion</a>:</u></strong> Increases damage dealt to targets effected by Unstable Affliction by 15%. 7.2.5 put this back to 15%, but its still incredibly strong for single and 2 target.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196103-absolute-corruption" target="_blank">Absolute Corruption</a>:</u></strong> Makes Corruption permanent (or 40 seconds in PVP) and makes it do 25% more damage. Lots of situations where this lets you drop a DOT from your rotation, really smoothing out rotations involving Malefic Grasp or on multiple targets.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/235157-empowered-life-tap" target="_blank">Empowered Life Tap</a>:</u></strong> This is a maintennce buff tied to life tap, increasing all damage YOU (doesn't apply to pets) deal by 10%. This is a strong talent for sustained AoE.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Contagion is generally the best choice, providing a large increase to your ST and cleave. Absolute Corruption is strong on multiple fights this tier where you can abuse infinite duration corruptions (Demonic Inquisition and Desolate Host stand out). ELT is useful in some Mythic+ situations where Seed of Corruption is a majority of your damage.</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 45:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a>:</u></strong> Place a portal on the ground, use it later to instantly travel up to 40 yards.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108396-mortal-coil" target="_blank">Mortal Coil</a>:</u></strong> Single Target horrify that also heals you.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5484-howl-of-terror" target="_blank">Howl of Terror</a>:</u></strong> AoE fear.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Demonic Circle is going to always be taken for raiding. Mortal Coil has some uses in Mythic+ as it does not share the same DR as stuns. Howl of Terror is almost only useable to proc Sephuz if you have the legendary (it is off of the GCD). In raids take Circle, in Mythic+ take Mortal Coil unless you need the circle (or don't care to respec)</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 60:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205179-phantom-singularity" target="_blank">Phantom Singularity</a>:</strong></u> Best for burst AoE.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196226-sow-the-seeds" target="_blank">Sow the Seeds</a>:</u></strong> Sustained AoE option.  Lets your Seed embed in 2 more targets, for up to 3 total explosions.  Extremely strong in Mythic+ and in many raid situations.</li>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196098-soul-harvest" target="_blank">Soul Harvest</a>:</strong></u> Burst Single Target option. This lets you get a solid damage inrcease to get past a burn requirement on a target, or to just rack up with a Wrath of Consumption buff. This will pull ahead of Phantom Singularity on single target if you can consitantly time it with a 5 stack of WoC or with multiple agonies out.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> PS and SH are nearly tied ST, and are your general raiding talents. SH gets your more boss damage, PS gets you more add damage. In Mythic+ you typically want Sow the Seeds, and anywhere there's sustained AoE.</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 75:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/219272-demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a>:</u></strong> Causes your Soul Leech to passively regen over time, and increases its cap to 20% of your max HP.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/111400-burning-rush" target="_blank">Burning Rush</a>:</u></strong> Run fast, kill yourself. Healers hate this. Warlocks love it.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108416-dark-pact" target="_blank">Dark Pact</a>:</u></strong> Big bubble on a relatively small cooldown.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This will depend on the fight. In general you're safe to run Burning Rush, as warlocks are incredibly tanky baseline. If you feel you don't need the mobility, Demon Skin is good on fights with constant damage, and Dark Pact is good on fights with periodic large hits of damage.

        <p><strong>Tier 90:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152107-grimoire-of-supremacy" target="_blank">Grimoire of Supremacy</a>:</strong></u> Gives you the ability to summon your Doomguard / Infernal as permanent pets instead of 3 min cooldowns. Doomguard has an interrupt and massive slow, and Infernal has an offensive dispel and an AoE stun. Infernal has been buffed significantly from the WoD version and is now a decent option for AoE damage. The biggest benefit with this talent is your ability to swap from single target to AoE inbetween pulls as needed in an instance, which is very powerful in Mythic+ dungeons where you cannot swap talents.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108501-grimoire-of-service" target="_blank">Grimoire of Service</a>:</u></strong> Gives you a cooldown every minute and a half, giving you a bonus Felhunter that deals twice damage that the standard one deals. Costs 1 Soul Shard. <strong>NOTE: GoServ Felhunter will interrupt when it spawns, giving you a bonus interrupt in Mythic+</strong></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108503-grimoire-of-sacrifice" target="_blank">Grimoire of Sacrifice</a>:</u></strong> Causes ALL spells to have an RPPM-based chance to pulse for AoE damage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> You will always be running Supremacy and using Doomguard while raiding (and basically everything else). Infernal is useful for sustained 3 or more targets, things like m+ and world quests. The other two talents are pretty bad and never really used for anything.

        <p><strong>Tier 100:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/234876-deaths-embrace" target="_blank">Death's Embrace</a>:</u></strong> This is a ramping execute, with 0% damage added at 35%, all the way to 50% bonus damage at 0%.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/63106-siphon-life" target="_blank">Siphon Life</a>:</u></strong> An additional dot providing some raw amount of damage and bonus healing.</li>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/215941-soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a>:</strong></u> 20% chance to refund any shard spent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> I recommend SC over SL in general, because it's easier to use and is better for target swapping. DE is roughly the same dps as the other talents for any talent combination. However, it's all backended, meaning you want to run it on fights execute is important on (e.g. Desolate Host, Eye of Azshara Mythic+). More often than not it's better to just use <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151649-soul-of-the-netherlord" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Soul of the Netherlord</span></a> than to actually talent DE.</p>

    <p><strong><span style="font-size:30px">Recommended Talent Builds</span></strong></p>
    <p>7.2.5 added a lot of balance in the talent tree, allowing for a wide array of builds. Mythic+ Builds are INCREDIBLY flexible, and will depend highly on affixes/dungeon/group composition. Sometimes you might need pure ST, others heavy AoE, others a healthy balance.</p>
