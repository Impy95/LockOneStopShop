  <ul>
    <li>You'll see this term a lot when researching Warlock. The basic concept is that you want to refresh a DoT when it has 30% of it's base duration remaining or less: <=5.4 seconds for Agony, <=4.5 seconds for Siphon Life, <=4.2 seconds for Corruption.</li>
    <li>Refreshing before a DoT hits 30% isn't the end of the world: the dps loss is tiny, and can actually be a dps gain if you're moving.</li>
    <li>Complicated Explanation (skip this if you don't care about math): Every DoT and HoT in wow can have its duration extended to up to 30% over base duration (130% total). When you apply a DoT/HoT, you effectively add 100% of its duration to the debuff. If you refresh a DoT/HoT at <30% of its base duration, you end up at or below 130%. If you refresh before the DoT/HoT hits 30%, you end up with more than 130%. Anything over 130% gets wasted.</li>
    <li>Example: Agony has a base duration of 18 seconds. The max duration it can have is 23.4 seconds (130% base). If you refresh at <=5.4 seconds (30% base) you will never exceed the 23.4 second cap. If you refresh at >5.4 seconds, you exceed 23.4 seconds and anything over that gets wasted. Say you refresh at 10 seconds remaining, 10+18=28. You've wasted 28.5-23.4=5.1 seconds.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/980-agony" target="_blank">Agony</a>:</u></strong> Our primary source of soul shards. Everytime the DoT deals damage it gains a stack, and the damage increases for every stack it has. Each tick also has a chance to generate a Soul Shard.</p>
  <p><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/27285-seed-of-corruption" target="_blank">Seed of Corruption</a>:</u></strong> Our AoE Soul Shard Spender. Can be used baseline to apply corruption to multiple targets, and talented to deal 3x more damage.</p>
  <p><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/30108-unstable-affliction" target="_blank">Unstable Affliction</a>:</u></strong> Our Single Target Soul Shard spender.  Costs 1 shard for an extremely high damage DoT.  A few notes on Unstable Affliction:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unlike other DoTs, it does not gain bonus damage from haste. It always deals damage 4 times.</li>
    <li>Has an 8 second duration, reduced by haste. Haste effectively just makes Unstable Affliction deal its full damage more quickly.</li>
    <li>If a target dies with an Unstable Affliction on it, you gain 1 Soul Shard. Note: Only 1 shard is refunded per target, multiple Unstable Afflictions on one target will only refund 1 shard.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198590-drain-soul" target="_blank">Drain Soul</a>:</u></strong> Base Filler (used when you have nothing else to do) spell. Heals for a lot, damage is meh. Generates a soul shard if the target dies under its effect.</p>
  
  <p><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Pets</span></strong><br>
  Doomguard is your default pet of choice. It provides an interrupt and the highest dps output ST. Infernal takes over best dps on 2+ stacked targets, and gives you a purge and an aoe stun. Infernal is generally better for questing and Mythic+, but you're pretty much only using Doomguard in raids.</p>
